            'Planned as the world’s tallest building when construction commenced in 1871, the tower was usurped by the Washington Monument and Eiffel Tower before its completion. Alexander Milne Calder’s 37-foot bronze William Penn is the tallest statue on any building anywhere, double the size of the Statue of Freedom on the U.S. Capitol.\nThat dome’s designer, Thomas Walker, came out of retirement to help architect John McArthur Jr. with this monumental edifice. Neither man lived to see their work completed. Calder, who crafted 250 sculptures for city hall and was there in 1894 to see his 27-ton Penn hoisted to its apex, despaired that the founder was installed looking north, which leaves his face perpetually in shadow.\nThe tower is built of load-bearing brick walls sheathed in marble and rests on 22-foot-thick granite walls at its base. Above the four clocks, marble gives way to white painted steel, a replacement of the original cast iron.\nBesides the internal clockwork and two extravagant mayoral and council rooms, the tower is basically empty but for a staircase and small, slow elevator to take passengers to the viewing deck. An unwritten agreement that kept Penn’s hat the tallest point in the city was finally broken in 1987.',

            'As the name implies, this tower provided offices for architects. It also was designed by them, as 20 firms participated in a committee headed by John Hall Rankin, respected dean of the field and former president of the local chapter of the American Institute of Architects.\nShortly after the building opened, the AIA held a public exhibition showcasing the work of several members who now occupied offices upstairs. Paul Cret, for instance, displayed photos of his Rodin Museum on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, recently dedicated and containing one of the most extensive collections of the Paris sculptor’s work. The AIA relocated in 2008, but its library on the top floor has been preserved as it once appeared.\nThe building, now the Hotel Palomar, has a sleek Art Deco exterior with handsome bronze panels and patterned brickwork testifying that the architects knew what they were doing. Best of all is the historic second floor elevator lobby, which combines vibrant tilework and carved wood with a dramatically coffered plaster ceiling and Welsh quarry tile floor.',

            'While Wanamaker’s is famed for its enormous pipe organ, this granite highrise built to hold a much-expanded men’s department for the store is known for the hourly tolls of its gigantic bell. The 17-ton Founder’s Bell, commissioned in memory of John Wanamaker, first rang on New Year’s Day 1927 from a special tower constructed on the roof of the great department store.\nIt was soon relocated to the belfry of the new Lincoln-Liberty Building, the first seven floors of which purveyed a tasteful array of tailored suits, fashionable overcoats, hunting costumes and sporting goods for the discerning gentleman, with high-end leasable office space and a penthouse above. A pair of much-admired 1890s skyscrapers had to be torn down to make way for the new construction, so its original appellation name-checked them both in order to assuage any hard feelings.\nAfter Philadelphia National Bank bought the tower, four sets of its illuminated initials “PNB” perched atop the belfry for nearly 60 years. They were finally removed by cargo helicopter in 2014 from the building now known as One South Broad, and one huge “B” was rehung in the lobby.',

            'The contours of this slab skyscraper are Art Deco, but slathered on top is an icing of terracotta and tiled rooftops and gazebos seemingly transplanted from Seville or Southern California. Developers named the luxury residential highrise for a celebrated English privateer who looted goodly sums of Spanish booty while claiming the Pacific coast for Queen Elizabeth I.\nArchitects Ritter & Shay also designed Market Street National Bank, a cousin to the Drake that features ornamentation more strictly Deco though no less exuberant. With 300 apartments and a cluster of penthouses, the Drake touted true high society city living.\nIn the 1970s, owners Stanton and Robert Miller ran high stakes bingo games in the ballroom five nights a week — allegedly for charity, in reality for their pockets. Unlike Sir Francis Drake, the Millers wound up sentenced to prison for their ill-gotten gains, and the property suffered through bankruptcy and other ignominies until its eventual renovation.\nThe two-story penthouse on top affords breathtaking views from its twin patios, but not from the red-roofed dome, which just hides a water tank.',

            'Said to be the world’s largest newspaper plant at the time of its construction, the Elverson Building was named for the Philadelphia Inquirer’s fourth owner, James Elverson — according to its fifth owner, his son James Elverson Jr., who commissioned it.\nIt was built over the tracks of the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad so that the huge rolls of newsprint feeding the presses could be delivered directly by train. The paper needed 800 tons of it per week; storage rooms held 200 railcars worth.\nElverson and his wife, Eleanore, a former actress, lived in apartments upstairs until he died of a heart attack in 1929 while planning festivities for the paper’s 100th anniversary. The tower’s four 16-foot clocks are accompanied by Westminster chimes; Elverson loved clocks and kept a collection of rare timepieces.\nThe Inquirer won 17 Pulitzers in its heyday from 1975 to 1990 before departing the premises in 2012. Plans to make the building into a casino were abandoned, and instead the granite and ivory terracotta highrise has been repurposed as police headquarters.',

            'Stephen Girard was one of the richest banking tycoons in American history, so the Philadelphian’s name held a natural appeal for financial institutions. The Girard Life Insurance, Annuity and Trust Company, formed five years after its namesake’s death, erected one of the city’s first highrises on the northeast corner of Broad and Chestnut.\nIn 1908, the truncated Girard Trust fittingly relocated to shorter headquarters — a two-story domed marble temple they built across the street. Eventually outgrowing that, they brought in the country’s preeminent architectural firm to design this tower, a marble-sheathed Neoclassical extension of their pantheon replica. A third skyscraper built next door in 1973, initially called Three Girard and later One Meridian Plaza, had to be demolished after it was gutted by a fire that also shut down the older highrise.\nIn 2000, the two marble Girard buildings reopened as a Ritz-Carlton, the city’s third. The first one still stands two blocks south on Broad Street; its owner built it out of spite when his wife was reprimanded for lighting a cigarette in the Bellevue-Stratford.',

Today’s grandiose dining room, with its 24-foot-high painted beam ceilings and square columns of red marble, was originally made for a bank.\nFounded by private financier Jay Cooke, the First National Bank of Philadelphia, as its name attests, was literally the first financial institution in the country chartered to print banknotes backed by the U.S. Treasury. Cooke was a private financier who loaned Pennsylvania $3 million to fund its Civil War efforts. He successfully lobbied President Abraham Lincoln and Congress to replace the country’s chaotic hodgepodge of state-run banks, establishing the banking system that exists to this day.\nLivingston Jones, First National president when this office opened, and his wife, Edith, were outdoorsy types who enjoyed canoe trips in Canada. Their daughter Cornelia became a Chestnut Hill sensation, becoming a pilot at 17 and competing in air races and shows.',

            'This concrete and steel office highrise with its stark bright cladding was added to an existing 16-story building on 15th Street that covers its lower floors with a far more staid Neoclassical facade. Its architect, Staten Island native Arthur Hall, designed army posts across the country during World War I, then came to Philadelphia, where he drew up the plans of at least two other skyscrapers and a number of Main Line homes.\nDeveloper Richard Seltzer put a gymnasium with squash and handball courts halfway up the slender skyscraper so office tenants had a convenient place to exercise. In 1960 the Penthouse restaurant and cocktail lounge opened on the top floor, offering patrons spectacular city views with their nightcaps.\nLewis Tower was purchased in 2004 for conversion into condominiums, but things got complicated the following year, when a piece of stone veneer broke off and crashed through the roof of the restaurant next door, prompting city officials to close the building. Now fully repaired and renovated, it has been redubbed the Aria.',

Later jobs besides the Equitable Building included the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Free Library of Philadelphia.\nWithin a year of its opening, this became the headquarters of the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company and its powerful and visionary boss, Thomas Mitten. Mitten took the top floor for his management business and leased 12 floors for the transit company, putting bus waiting rooms and ticket offices on the ground floor along with his bank and securities company, which then acquired the property and renamed it the Mitten Building. Two years later, the city sued Mitten for alleged financial scams, and soon afterward his drowned body was discovered in a fishing pond on his Poconos estate.\nA theater next door on Broad Street had its main lobby in the Equitable Building; its marquee still hangs over the Locust Street sidewalk, though the theater is now a parking garage and the lobby is a restaurant.',

            'With his city in the midst of a highrise boom, James Willcox, president of the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society, felt his institution’s planned new office tower had to make a statement to attract new tenants. Thus America got its first International Style skyscraper, a cubist masterpiece of polished granite, limestone, glass, and brick.\nInside and out, it emphasizes what architect George Howe called “the beautiful surfaces of machine production,” relying on simple geometric forms and lines for its appeal. Escalators brought customers to the banking hall on the second floor, a vast open space where ranks of boxy marble columns rise 30 feet to the ceiling and support the building above.\nThis was one of the first fully air conditioned office towers, and its trademark rooftop sign hides the cooling machinery. The TV tower is not original, added in 1948.\nFurniture and fixtures were custom designed by the architects to complement their bold design, and main interior spaces have been meticulously preserved. The building is now a hotel, and guests seeking out the former boardroom on the 33rd floor can enjoy a sweeping panorama from Fairmount Park to the Delaware River.',

It was erected for the American Baptist Publication Society, which for years had printed and sold religious tracts and Bibles at its offices here, maintained a library, and coordinated various charitable causes until an 1896 fire destroyed it all.\nThe new building’s French style obviously curtsies to Philadelphia City Hall, while its name honors the society’s former president, John Crozer, a wealthy textile manufacturer and dedicated philanthropist. The building opened in time for Christmas in 1897, and visitors marveled at its finely appointed bookstore with oak cabinetry, cushioned settees for browsing, and a dainty reading room for women. \nThe lecture hall upstairs seated 600 guests, with high ceilings painted in allegorical frescoes. The exterior has suffered a bit since then, losing its original street-level façade and a sumptuous balcony railing that once stretched just below the steep mansard roof. But it still provides elegant quarters for the aspiring electricians who study at the charter trade school now located here.',

            'A rich marble staircase worn by a century of shoe leather leads from the sidewalk entrance to what was originally a brightly sunlit banking floor. Now an appealing modern hotel lobby, it still preserves Liberty Title & Trust’s original marble tiled floors, elaborate crown molding and wall medallions, and a bronze elevator that accessed the old safety deposit boxes, which are now stacked on a giant bookcase for atmosphere.\nArchitect Frederic Hirons liked to blend old and new motifs too, both here and in his Beaux-Arts Institute of Design in Manhattan, which opened shortly after this building did. In digging the foundations, builders discovered a buried creek feeding the Schuylkill River. They spent months pumping out millions of gallons of water to stabilize the soggy soil; appropriately, years later, the highrise housed the city water department. \nThis was the only building on the block spared when the convention center expanded to Broad Street. That was because the authority intended to put their headquarters here, but as costs ballooned, officials had to abandon their plan.',

            'The founders of the National Bank of North Philadelphia, which opened in 1920, chose as their first president the attorney Charles Beury, a graduate of Princeton and Harvard Law. The financial institution’s rapid success led to construction of Uptown’s first skyscraper, called the National Bank of North Philadelphia Building.\nBeury, meanwhile, had new presidential obligations. An influential trustee at nearby Temple University, he was picked for the executive job following the death of the institution’s founder. Refocused on the university, Beury remained the bank’s chairman until it was acquired by Bankers Trust Company in 1930. The successors renamed the building after him in September, then three months later became the first large Philadelphia bank to fail in the Great Depression.\nBeury guided Temple’s steady growth in his 15 years as president, and a building on campus also bears his name. His once-stylish Art Deco tower on Broad Street long stood abandoned, crumbling, and infamously adorned by a pair of graffiti artists who proudly tagged it with their noms-de-can: “Forever” and “Boner.” After decades of neglect, it is being renovated into a hotel.',

            'Ever since Ben Franklin flew his famous kite, electricity has played a key role in the City of Brotherly Love. On New Year’s Eve 1927, Thomas Edison himself sent a telegraph message to this new office tower named in his honor and owned by Philadelphia Electric Company.\nOn the elderly inventor’s signal, keyed from his home in Menlo Park, 483 floodlights flicked on to bathe the upper floors of the Edison in a rainbow of nighttime illumination. Behind the new skyscraper on Sansom Street was a six-story coal-fired electrical station Edison’s company had built in 1888, before mergers consolidated the city’s power businesses.\nArchitect John T. Windrim designed several power plants, including an immense Beaux-Arts station on the Delaware River in Chester, and went on to design the Lincoln-Liberty Building. His bold diamond patterns in the ground-level brickwork subtly repeat near the top. They are eclipsed, however, by the building’s latest light display, an illuminated sign for Thomas Jefferson University, which acquired the property in 1973.\nThe smokestack rises from a power plant next door that stands on the footprint of Edison’s original generating station.',

            'When John Bowman became chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh in 1921, he proposed a bold plan for his growing institution: a college skyscraper. Philadelphia architect Charles Klauder, renowned for his campus buildings at Princeton and Cornell, designed the tower as a blend of Art Deco and his signature Collegiate Gothic style.\nGround was broken in 1926, and the first classes were held in the building in 1931, though the Great Depression delayed completion of the dramatic four-story Commons Room for six more years. The 40-story limestone highrise was the tallest educational building in the world until Moscow State University surpassed it in 1953.\nAt the time of construction, surveys showed that one of every three Pitt students was the child of an immigrant. To honor that heritage, the university invited Pittsburgh’s various ethnic organizations to design and fund 18 Nationality Rooms representing the mother countries. Students taking classes in the rooms, which now number 31, quickly learn to expect occasional interruptions by curious visitors peeking in the doorways.',

            'Heinrich Koppers of Germany developed an efficient industrial oven for producing coke, the essential fuel for iron and steel furnaces, while also capturing gas and tar byproducts for other uses. That interested U.S. Steel, so Koppers formed a Chicago company in 1907 to supply the American steel industry.\nFinancier Andrew Mellon soon acquired a controlling stake and moved the company to Pittsburgh. During World War I, he forced the German founder out entirely, and soon thereafter became Secretary of the Treasury.\nGraham, Anderson, Probst & White designed the company’s Art Deco headquarters with a polished granite and limestone exterior and a chateau-style roof made of – what else – copper. It was briefly the city’s tallest skyscraper until overshadowed by the Gulf Building across the street, the headquarters of another company in the Mellon portfolio.\nKoppers grew into a sprawling industrial conglomerate until a 1988 British hostile takeover led to the sale of several divisions. Managers bought the chemicals business, which is still based in the skyscraper. The building’s three-story marble lobby with bronze accents has been extensively restored.',

            'After Thomas Keenan made a fortune selling his newspaper, the Pittsburgh Press, he commissioned the first skyscraper on Liberty Avenue. Its signature flourish, a cast concrete baroque dome, was inspired by an even more elaborate dome capping the headquarters of the San Francisco Call.\nThe Keenan dome was originally gold, not red, and was crowned by a large globe and eagle. First to move in under the golden dome was a photography studio, then for decades the uppermost stories housed a school for women.\nKeenan crusaded against civic corruption and vice; that, along with his bachelor status, may explain false rumors that he lived in a penthouse under the dome and used it for trysts. Today the space is a community room for residents of what is now called Midtown Towers. It has been extensively remodeled after a 2017 fire.\nTen bas-reliefs at sidewalk level honor important public figures including city namesake William Pitt, philanthropist Mary Schenley, and H.D.W. English, president of the chamber of commerce, which moved its offices here when the building opened.',

But the dozen letters spelling Bromo-Seltzer that replace traditional numerals on the clocks indicate how far Isaac Emerson was willing to go to flog his product.\nThe former drugstore proprietor invented a fizzy elixir to treat headaches and indigestion, and encouraged its widespread adoption by other druggists through offers of company stock in exchange for high sales volume. The powder was packaged in attractive blue glass bottles, samples of which are displayed in a quaint museum on the top floor.\nEmerson’s factory is gone, but the tower it was attached to was given to the city when the drug company left town. Too skinny for offices — two-thirds of each floor is used up by the elevator, stairs, and landing — it has been converted into loft space for artists.',

Its spectacular mosaic floor by the acclaimed muralist Hildreth Meière — creator of Radio City Music Hall’s signature sculptures — is covered with mats to protect it.\nOnce the state’s biggest financial institution, Baltimore Trust did not survive the 1933 banking panic. Now a residential highrise, the building has changed hands and names repeatedly. Its most colorful owner, West Virginia millionaire and political gadfly Raymond J. Funkhouser, renamed it the O’Sullivan building in 1942 after a company he owned that made rubber shoe heels. He also kicked an upscale barbershop out of the top floor so he could put his penthouse there.',

            'Ever since its unveiling, “Wings of Progress,” the bold 42-foot aluminum sculpture capping this bank highrise, has tempted residents of Rochester to speculate on its meaning. Some say it represents maple seedpods or bat wings, others say a screwdriver or an arrowhead shattered by the city’s brutal winters.\nArchitect Ralph Walker, who helped to establish the canon for Art Deco skyscrapers with his Barclay-Vesey and Irving Trust buildings in Manhattan, said he wanted to convey a sense of flight and was inspired by seashells he found on the beach in Florida. Hailed by the American Institute of Architects in 1957 as “architect of the century,” Walker later resigned from the organization over an ethics controversy. He committed suicide at the age of 83, rumor has it with a silver bullet he forged for himself.\nThe bank moved out after a 1955 merger, and the new owner redubbed this the Times Square Building after the former name of the intersection where it stands. A dramatic red marble lobby still features the original chandelier. Stylized bas-reliefs over the front windows by New York sculptor Leo Friedlander depict two Greek goddesses representing security and trust.',

            'The city council of Buffalo made the best decision in its history in 1926 when it rejected its municipal architect’s uninspiring plan for a new civic building. Instead they turned to John Wade, an opinionated local designer who produced one of the most spectacular Art Deco highrises ever constructed.\nThe elegantly stepped sandstone mass features stylized carvings and polychromatic terracotta in geometric Native American motifs. A frieze over the entrance depicts the city writing her future, surrounded by stevedores, ironworkers, and research chemists; the rear frieze showcases key historic episodes. In the lobby are vivid, almost comic book murals of musclebound men and gleaming women by William de Leftwich Dodge, whose work also decorates the Library of Congress and the New York State Capitol.\nBuffalo’s councilmen could not agree on which citizens to honor in their 13th floor chambers. So instead, identical busts represent various virtues, lit by a large stained glass skylight of the rising sun.Visitors to the free observatory on the top floor can take in the sprawling cityscape, Lake Erie, and distant Niagara Falls.\nA park in front has an obelisk to President William McKinley, assassinated in Buffalo in 1901. Bronze statues of the two presidents who hailed from the city, Millard Fillmore and Grover Cleveland, are the site’s sole concession to mediocrity.',

            'If the 40-foot spire atop the Rand Building was originally intended as a mooring mast for zeppelins, as is sometimes claimed, that plan never got off the ground. But searchlights and red neon made the spire a helpful beacon for airplanes in the days before radar, and it still blinks at night today.\nIt is a sobering tribute to the building’s namesake, George Rand Sr., who died in a plane crash in England in 1919. Rand was president of Marine Trust, one of the state’s largest banks. He was returning from Paris, where Rand had offered the French prime minister a large private sum to fund a new war memorial.\nGeorge Rand Jr. soon succeeded his father and oversaw planning of this new headquarters for the bank, which was the city’s tallest skyscraper for more than 40 years. The 18th floor housed the studios of radio station WGR, whose call letters also commemorate George Rand.\nThis was the sole skyscraper designed by Franklyn and William Kidd, who immigrated with their parents from Scotland. Franklyn designed a mansion for the Rands in 1918, which helped him to land this commission.',

            'The back-to-back Statues of Liberty facing east and west from this rooftop signify Buffalo’s importance as a water transport nexus on the Erie Canal. They were designed by Italian immigrant sculptor Leo Lentelli, who had gazed upon the much larger original when he sailed into New York harbor.\nThe financial institution that erected this skyscraper was founded in 1882 for immigrants as the German American Bank. America’s entry into World War I prompted a name change in 1918 which, besides being patriotic, was a shrewd marketing scheme. The U.S. government was heavily promoting war bonds, and the renamed institution took out ads urging: “Buy your Liberty Bonds at the Liberty Bank.”\nArchitect Alfred Bossom was an immigrant too. After a career in New York designing skyscrapers, he returned to England, served in Parliament for 28 years, and became a mentor to Margaret Thatcher, the future prime minister.\nThe lobby has extraordinary coffered ceilings and a carved marble version of the rooftop statues in a niche behind the security desk. The statues are modeled on the bank logo, a modernized version of Lady Liberty with short hair and an athletic build.',

Unfortunately, that optimism proved to be unwarranted. Buffalo’s urban core failed to expand here, and even if it had, the age of the automobile spelled the end of passenger rail.\nThe facility was designed to handle 200 trains and 10,000 people daily, with an attached office skyscraper whose lobby also served as the main entrance to the station. Alfred Fellheimer was a railway terminal expert and the lead architect of Grand Central Station in New York; his firm also designed Cincinnati’s train station, considered an Art Deco masterpiece, at roughly the same time as this one.\nThe last train chugged out Buffalo station in 1979, and weeds now grow over its disused platforms. The property badly deteriorated under subsequent owners, a victim of weather, vandalism, and arson. Preservationists bought it in 1997 for one dollar plus back taxes. They restored the tower clocks and the main concourse, and recently released a master plan for renovating the rest of the abandoned complex.',

            'To celebrate its pioneering power grid supplied by turbines at Niagara Falls, Buffalo erected a temporary 391-foot Electric Tower at its 1901 World’s Fair. Buffalo General Electric supplied current to light the hundreds of bulbs that festooned it, and a decade later the company commissioned a smaller version of the tower for its own offices.\nThis was designed by local architects August Esenwein and James Johnson, who had done several buildings for the fair, though not the original tower. In addition to offices, the new building had a product showroom and a transformer station in the basement. At the summit was an auditorium for company meetings and a public observation deck and searchlights that could be seen more than 50 miles away.\nA few elements of the exterior have been lost over the years, such as a sculpture of two youths admiring a dynamo. The tower housed power company offices for most of its existence, much of it under the name of parent corporation Niagara Mohawk after a 1950 consolidation. It was sold to an independent developer in 2004, and the lobby has been substantially restored from earlier remodeling.',

            '“Harmony without dullness” is how architect Henry Churchill summarized this office highrise, still the tallest building in central New York. Besides its bold terracotta accent panels, the bricks get lighter the higher they go, adding an illusion of sunlight even on gloomy days. Inside, the elevator lobby is a controlled riot of geometric designs.\nBuilt for New York developer Albert Meyer, the tower was the fruit of a creative if short-lived partnership between Churchill and Stuart Thompson. In their home base of Manhattan, their Lowell Hotel still has a lush pink tiled entrance, and their Bauhaus-style glass box loft was one of very few American buildings included in the 1932 Museum of Modern Art exhibition that defined the International Style.\nThe skyscraper stands on the site of a prior office block destroyed in a 1923 fire that killed three people and triggered a new city requirement for sprinklers. A 1962 gas explosion was strong enough to buckle the State Tower Building’s basement walls, but fortunately caused only a few injuries. The property has undergone recent renovations and now has apartments in its upper floors.',

One wonders if Clarence Hills, the real estate broker who commissioned and named the highrise, intended some sort of statement.\nThe building’s designer, Melvin King, swept floors as an apprentice for prominent Syracuse architect Archimedes Russell until securing paid employment. He ultimately became partner, was lead designer of the nearby 1906 Beaux-Arts county courthouse, and went on to create a gleaming Art Deco tour-de-force five blocks away, the Niagara Hudson Building. King eventually turned the business over to his son and nephew; King & King is now New York’s oldest continuously operating architectural firm.\nCarved ornamental columns in the Hills Building’s granite base attractively frame its entrance arch. A small but elegant lobby features gilded beams and ribs supporting a vaulted ceiling, ornamental grapevine crown molding, terrazzo floors, and contrasting marble in mottled beige and streaked ebony.',

            'Chartered in 1849, the Syracuse Savings Bank was the first bank to open in a city that was then only a year old. By 1874 the institution needed new headquarters and announced a design competition. The winning entry came from Joseph Silsbee, a recent graduate of the nation’s first school of architecture at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nVisitors thrilled to ride in the city’s first elevator for views from the top of the tower, where Silsbee put his office. He helped to establish Syracuse University’s architecture department, prospered with more commissions, and eventually relocated to Chicago. But this steep-gabled sandstone edifice is still considered Silbee’s masterpiece, a textbook example of High Victorian Gothic. Preservationists in the 1960s made it a centerpiece in their fight against unbridled urban redevelopment. \nThe bank once stood over the Erie Canal, which ran through downtown Syracuse until it was filled in during the 1920s to become Erie Avenue. The impressive banking room is still in use and has the original beamed ceilings and extensive gothic trimmings. The main block’s top three floors were recently remodeled into luxury apartments. A carillon once chimed in the tower but has been silent for decades.',

            'Like many government jobs, this highrise was controversial before the first girder was hoisted. Opponents railed over the site and cost. The designer quit when his independent post of state architect was subsumed under the public works department.\nBut its champion, Al Smith, four-term governor of New York, pressed relentlessly for a tower to house Albany’s scattered state workforce. Smith oversaw planning and even manned the steam shovel at the groundbreaking. Then, with construction underway, he ran for president against Herbert Hoover and lost in a landslide.\nHis gubernatorial successor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, won the White House four years later. Smith exited politics to head the corporation that raised the Empire State Building. Months after his death in 1945, legislators renamed the state office tower in Smith’s honor. Today it stands above the State Capitol and Empire State Plaza like an Art Deco transition from the Gilded Age to the Space Age.\nThe lobby ceiling is painted with murals of important New Yorkers, and all 62 counties have their names carved into the facade. Ten important ones get a big font treatment — but not the neglected Bronx, small and nearly hidden on the side of the entrance.',

            'Most of this building is actually an addition. The left side was the original 10-story skyscraper, designed by Marcus Reynolds, a prominent and well-connected local architect. Two decades later in 1922, the bank brought back Reynolds for a major expansion project that added six more window bays and the central clock tower, plus a large addition in the rear.\nReynolds, who designed numerous Albany landmarks including the castle-like Delaware and Hudson Building and the domed Albany Trust Building, had his offices in this highrise. So did the Thachers, an industrial and political dynasty who ran the bank and a railcar wheel works and could boast of three members elected mayor of the city between 1860 and 1940.\nThe main hall in the middle, once used for banking, is now used for banqueting. Marble pillars with gilded capitals soar above the potted palms, supporting a dramatic vaulted ceiling. The original side has a metallic coffered ceiling and a bronze arched doorway leading into the event space. Passersby are likely unaware that one pair of winged lions leering down at them from above is considerably younger than the pair a few steps up the sidewalk.',

His work also embellishes the State Office Tower in town, as well as more famous skyscrapers including the American Radiator Building in Manhattan, Tribune Tower in Chicago, and Buffalo City Hall. The spiraling foliage motif repeats in carvings below on the granite base of the structure and on the ceiling inside the former banking hall, now used for wedding receptions and galas.\nThe financial institution that paid for this highrise boasted in ads that it was “Albany’s most beautiful savings bank.” An elegant scroll and wreath in low relief on the facade below the bank’s carved name commemorates its founding in 1871. Beneath that are additional profiles of the original residents of the region, interspersed with their noisy new neighbors.',

            'This former railroad terminal was inspired by the Cloth Hall in Ypres, a Flemish Gothic landmark badly damaged in World War I just as this homage was being constructed in Albany. Delaware and Hudson, which began as a canal bringing barges from the Scranton coalfields to New York, was one of six rail lines serving the state capital. Its new offices were devised to block the view from State Street of unsightly railyards and steamer docks at the riverfront.\nA more romantic explanation is sometimes proffered: that the building marks the spot where Henry Hudson forlornly came ashore in his failed search for a fabled Northwest Passage to the Pacific Ocean. His ship, Half Moon, spins on the rooftop weathervane.\nThe State University of New York purchased the complex in 1972 to convert into the main administration offices for its more than 60 campuses. Arcaded main hallways with vaulted tile ceilings are the last original interiors. Luxurious former apartments of a newspaper publisher and political boss at the south end of the complex used to be offered to SUNY chancellors, but they have been converted into office space.',

            'This tall office in glazed terracotta seems tasteful, graceful, and deliberately unobtrusive so as not to steal the spotlight from its celebrated neighbor across the street, the New York State Capitol. That was surely deliberate: Paul Gmelin, the German-born architect who drew it up, worked for a New York firm founded by the son of Leopold Eidlitz, one of the architects who worked on the capitol.\nAlbany was an early adopter of telecommunications technology. One year after Alexander Graham Bell won the gold medal for his invention at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, the city became the first to get phones for its police department, hooking up a set for the chief with one at each precinct house and another for the mayor.\nDemand only grew, eventually requiring this local administrative headquarters and exchange for New York Telephone. A decade later, the architect was called back to expand the building the full length of the block. It doubled in size again in the 1960s, this time with a modern appearance meant to blend with its new neighbor, Empire State Plaza. It remains a telephone administrative office building to this day.',

            'The 1920s design revolution known as Art Deco took some interesting turns, including a brief fascination with Mayan motifs such as the painted friezes on this highrise. Buffalo architect James Johnson intended them to offset the stark verticality of what was the tallest skyscraper on the American side of Niagara Falls for almost 80 years.\nIt was constructed as the main headquarters of United Hotels, a luxury chain created by lawyer and entrepreneur Frank Dudley. Dudley helped to form several local ventures including a trolley company, an electric utility, and the city’s first country club. He also developed the city’s upscale Lewiston Heights neighborhood, where James designed a mansion for Dudley and his wife, Harriet.\nUnited was one of the era’s biggest hotel chains, with properties in the United States, Canada, and overseas. A flagship was the Niagara Hotel across the street, which has been vacant for several years. So was this highrise until it was renovated and reopened as a boutique hotel and apartment complex. The top story is now an observation room where guests can watch the river hurl itself over the escarpment to become the American Falls.',

In addition to more than 300 students, the towering dormitory also houses the chancellor of the institution in its two-story penthouse.\nThough not as prominent as Newark-based competitor Prudential, American Insurance Company was founded decades before the more famous firm. Father and son architects John and Wilson Ely, who designed Newark City Hall, drew up this building and the nearby Newark & Essex Building at about the same time. Both buildings were erected contemporaneously, and both were delayed simultaneously by an ironworker strike.\nAmerican Insurance was acquired in 1963 and its staff relocated to the suburbs a decade later. Rutgers turned the building into its law school in 1979, a bit too late for Professor Ginsburg, who had moved on to teach at Columbia by then. When the law school got a new home in 1999, this highrise stood vacant for more than a decade until converted to student housing.

            'Newark’s tallest skyscraper also surpassed every other New Jersey building for almost 60 years. Though its shape is similar to other Art Deco towers of its time, in its ornamentation the highrise is decidedly Neoclassical, the preferred style of local father and son architects John and Wilson Ely.\nTen murals from the original banking halls at mezzanine level depict key people in Newark history, including the founding Puritans who purchased land for a settlement on the west bank of the Passaic River from the resident Lenni Lenape in 1666. Also shown is Elisha Boudinot, a lawyer and spy for George Washington who became a state supreme court justice after the war and the founding president of Newark’s first bank.\nThat institution merged with Essex County National Bank in 1903, which accounts for the original name of this highrise, though it was simplified long ago to National Newark Building. Now occupied by law firms, the tower initially housed numerous government offices including the state liquor control board. When Prohibition was repealed in 1933, the building was so mobbed by prospective bar owners seeking a liquor license that a police guard was required and the office stayed open past midnight.',

The four clock faces held special significance for Adolph Sieroty, a Polish immigrant who got his start in L.A. retail when he opened a clock shop.\nBolstered by Sieroty’s willingness to sell on credit, the business grew into Eastern Outfitting, a California chain of furniture and housewares stores. A retail clothing business, Columbia Outfitting, prospered too, and in 1930 Sieroty put both into this flagship store. Entering through the three-story vestibule under a Mayan-inspired sunburst design in gold leaf and glazed tiles, visitors could stroll past displays for Columbia men’s and women’s outfits on the left and Eastern home furnishings on the right. Up above, beneath the clock, a model bungalow showhome stood in the rooftop garden. Fashion shows filled the 700-seat auditorium on the 12th floor.\nThe retail business closed in 1957, and Sieroty’s son Julian converted the tower to office space. Now it has been renovated as a condominium with 147 residential units. Swimmers in the rooftop pool never have to wonder what time it is.',

            'What was once New Jersey’s tallest office tower took its name from the neighboring six-acre lawn, a former drill ground for Continental Army troops under George Washington that later became a Civil War recruitment point. While Military Park now contains a sword-shaped flowerbed and a war sculpture by the artist who carved Mount Rushmore, the highrise it fronts picks up the martial theme with panels depicting Union soldiers, one dressed in stylish Zouave garb.\nGrotesque warrior figures along the second floor further emphasize the military spirit, as did the maintenance staff and elevator operators who wore cadet-style uniforms when this building first opened. Maurice Strunsky, the New York developer who led the project, had immigrated from present-day Belarus and seems to have wanted to emphasize his patriotism. An enormous U.S. flag was draped the full 21 stories of this building at its dedication, aptly held on Memorial Day.\nWhen Newark’s economy bottomed out in the 1970s, the Military Park Building was the site of city vacant property auctions. Renovated two decades ago, it now contains mostly law offices, with the Newark Downtown District, a beautification and urban improvement nonprofit organization, on the uppermost floor.',

            'When a one-ton weight in Camden’s old city hall clock tower crashed down in 1929, narrowly missing four commissioners and three secretaries, officials congratulated themselves for having already started construction of a replacement.\nTo emphasize that Camden was the home of RCA Victor, a leader in sound recording and radio, the new clock tower housed a “synthetic tone producer” that mimicked the chime of Big Ben. Loudspeakers mounted to the tower blasted loud enough to be heard two miles away, causing floors to vibrate inside city hall.\nIt was all meant as a bold statement to put Camden on the map. A line by poet and longtime Camden resident Walt Whitman carved into the granite exterior gives a sense of the spirit of the project: “In a dream I saw a city invincible.”\nBut a year after the opening and further into the Great Depression, more than 3,000 angry taxpayers crowded into the building for hearings about wasteful government spending. Frederick von Nieda, a former councilman and future mayor, announced to cheers: “Camden bought a high hat and a diamond ring when it needed a pair of shoes and pants.” Subsequent efforts to sell the building have never come to fruition.',

Politicians and lobbyists once flocked to its Caucus Room lounge to wheel and deal late into the evening.\nCommissioned by an investment group headed by building contractor Ray Shoemaker, this handsome brick tower features stone false balconies and Art Deco trim. But by 1969, it had declined to the point of hosting a national hobo jamboree. A real estate businessman named Charles Adler and a few of his associates snapped it up that year with the stated aim of converting it to office space.\nAdler was also the campaign fundraising boss for gubernatorial candidate Milton Shapp, and when Shapp won, he made Adler his deputy secretary for state procurement. The new governor soon came under fire when the state took a sizeable lease in the former hotel. Pundits called it “Milton’s Hilton,” but Shapp survived the controversy. Today the tenant mix includes attorneys, state officials, and nonprofits.',

            'To celebrate the opening of their new skyscraper courthouse, the judges of Berks County reinstated the practice of wearing judicial robes while serving on the bench. The tradition had fallen by the wayside, but robes seemed an appropriate degree of formality for the fancy new courtrooms on the fifth and seventh floors.\nEven more striking was the lobby, which is beautifully preserved in contrasting ocher and black marble with hammered bronze elevator doors and an Italian Renaissance painted beam ceiling. Hanging above the guard desk is an original stained glass light globe of the Earth, while above the side entrance is a shield inscribed “Justitia et Lux,” Latin for justice and light.\nMiles Dechant, the local architect picked for the job, nevertheless was assailed for supposedly cutting corners. His rooftop soars with four great eagles, but county commissioners had to squabble with Dechant to supply additional promised rows of decorative lion heads. Critics alleged he used imitation gold leaf but charged for the real thing.\nCounty offices expanded to a Postmodern highrise next door in 1991. But court is still in session in Reading’s granite and limestone tower.',

            'Seeking a steady hand at the controls in 1920 when eight utilities merged into Pennsylvania Power & Light, board members chose Edward Hall, a lawyer and well-connected corporate executive. Under Hall’s direction, the company broke ground on this tower, decorated with avant-garde carvings by Alexander Archipenko and topped since the day it opened with a tall flagpole.\nHall is also heralded as the savior of modern football, owing to his work as chairman of the fledgling NCAA rules committee from 1908 until his death in 1932. He championed the forward pass to speed up the game, and pushed to eliminate plays such as the “flying wedge” that led to serious injuries and occasional death on the gridiron.\nThis was the first skyscraper project for architect Wallace Harrison, who soon went on with partner Harvey Corbett to join the design team responsible for Rockefeller Center. Harrison became a major New York architect, overseeing the United Nations and Lincoln Center complexes and designing numerous midcentury skyscrapers for Time-Life, McGraw-Hill, and Exxon, as well as Empire State Plaza in Albany after his earlier patron, Nelson Rockefeller, became governor.',

            'As native son Joe Biden and fans of “The Office” know, Scranton calls itself the Electric City. A sign five stories high on the original offices of the local board of trade has spelled out that moniker since 1916. The illuminated sign was put there by one of the building’s main tenants — unsurprisingly, an electric company — and refers to Scranton boasting one of the nation’s first electric trolley lines.\nAn earlier sign saying “Watch Scranton Grow” was the first to grace the rooftop in 1907. Scranton was doing exactly that at the time, as a prosperous shipping hub for the nearby anthracite coal mines.\nScranton merchants and businessmen had raised funds the previous decade to erect this eight-story building, which stands opposite the courthouse on the main square. With its name carved into the stone, the predecessor of the chamber of commerce occupied the top two floors and leased the rest to other businesses and private clubs.\nScranton Electric took ownership the year after it put up the Electric City sign, and the structure became known as the Electric Building. For a time it housed government offices, and it is now under renovation to be headquarters for its latest owner, a local bank.',

The green lantern at its tip could serve as a lighthouse for Narragansett Bay. Four stone eagles above it once glared at Boston and the mansions of Newport, but when one of their heads broke off and plummeted to the ground, the other three were decapitated for safety.\nIndustrial Trust was founded in 1886 by Samuel Colt, a former Rhode Island attorney general and nephew and namesake of the famed pistol maker. He did not live to see construction of this new headquarters, which features stone friezes of Providence’s founding on one side and the birth of the city’s industries on the other.\nThe great banking hall is well preserved, with tall black marble columns lining either side. But it has been unused since 2013, when successor Bank of America became the last tenant to depart, leaving the building vacant. The threat of demolition spurred action, and in 2022 the owners announced a government-subsidized plan to convert the building into 285 rental apartments.',

Travelers opened a new, nine-story Beaux-Arts headquarters in 1907, widened it just a few years later, and added the tower as a second expansion to accommodate the bigger sales force needed to meet demand for a popular new product: automobile insurance.\nThe son of a stone carver, Travelers founder James Batterson went from making gravestones to supplying granite and marble for major public buildings, including the Library of Congress, and Civil War monuments at Gettysburg and elsewhere. A trans-Atlantic voyage introduced Batterson to the European concept of accident insurance for travelers, and upon returning he launched the first U.S. company to offer such a policy.\nBatterson’s quarries supplied the granite for this building as well as the Connecticut State Capitol across town. Celebrated New York architect Donn Barber, who did all three Travelers projects, died at age 53 just weeks before he was supposed to speak at the 1925 Paris exposition that gave birth to the term “Art Deco.”\nPublic tours to the arched observatory atop Travelers Tower were discontinued in the 1990s, when winds blew an original spire encircled with brass globes off the cupola.',

            'A bell tower modeled after the famous Venice campanile centers the Springfield Municipal Group, where it is flanked by matching city and symphony halls. The complex replaced an old city hall that burned down in 1906. The campanile has endured a similarly troublesome existence.\nA nighttime explosion blew a hole through the base while it was still under construction. When the saboteurs were apprehended, they confessed to a string of bombings and said they took orders from a national ironworkers union in a scheme to terrorize capitalists into employing only unionized workers on construction projects. One got life in San Quentin.\nFormer president William Howard Taft came to hear the chimes and bronze bell peal at the dedication, and the problems seemed to be over. Then 25 years later, a repair crew checking the malfunctioning chimes found flattened bullets scattered on the observation deck and realized the tower was being used for target practice. Surely some shooters used Springfield rifles, which were manufactured at the major federal arms works in town for more than a century.\nDecades have passed since the tower bells last tolled, and the clock is also out of commission. Black safety netting keeps the limestone corners from crumbling while funds are sought for an extensive and expensive restoration.',

            'As a federal office, the Custom House in Boston was exempt from the city’s strict building code height restrictions. For decades it dominated the harborfront, buzzing with the activity of customs agents collecting tariffs on imported goods unloaded from ships docked at the wharf.\nBefore the United States adopted the income tax, tariffs and customs duties were the main source of federal revenue. When the busy port of Boston outgrew its 1847 custom house, a committee decided to preserve the stately edifice while shooting a tower nearly 500 feet tall through the top of its original dome. The unorthodox design was one of the last by Boston architects Robert Peabody and John Stearns, who died in 1917 at their respective summer homes within a week of each other.\nThe property was converted into a timeshare hotel in 1997, and guests now gather in its former counting room each morning for the breakfast buffet. Its impressive multistory rotunda is ringed with the flags of prominent merchant shipping firms from long ago. Above the tower clock faces, an outdoor public observatory offers spectacular views from all four sides. Visits are free and require only an advance reservation.',

            'The wedding cake shape of this and other Deco-era American highrises was due to zoning rules requiring floors above a certain height to step back, letting more sunlight down to the street. Such limits clearly could not quash this building’s exuberance, with its terracotta floral panels stretching to the roofline.\nNearer to the sidewalk, stylized bronze bas-reliefs display acts of labor and technological prowess by burly men who are mostly shirtless and occasionally pants-less. Mythical heroic figures join the cast over the main entrance on Franklin Street. A well-preserved honey and ebony marble lobby shows off additional craftsmanship and metalwork.\nThe highrise was financed by a consortium led by Louis Abrons, a New York builder whose family immigrated from present-day Belarus when he was a boy. One lead investor was stockbroker Charles Hayden, who made a fortune in copper mining, then built public planetariums in Boston and New York that still bear his name.\nOriginally called the Tower Building, this was more commonly referred to by its ground floor tenants Second National Bank and later State Street Trust. In 1985 the building became part of 75-101 Federal Street when it was fused to a taller office tower erected next door after Boston finally relaxed its height limits.',

            'Strict municipal height restrictions historically kept Boston out of the skyscraper races. But with this building, the venerable city ironically served as the proving ground for one of the master architects of turn-of-the-century highrises.\nCass Gilbert had earned renown in 1895 by winning a competition to design the new capitol building in his home state of Minnesota. The following year he secured his first tall office project, this Beaux-Arts confection for brokers, bankers, and bond sellers. The job helped entice Gilbert to relocate to New York City, where he designed even more elaborate skyscrapers, culminating in the world’s tallest, the Woolworth Building.\nThe wedge-shaped edifice on the original site of Boston’s first town hall replaced an earlier office block built for John Brazer, a successful merchant. His granddaughter, Alice Brooks Norris, inherited half of the first Brazer Building and was a major shareholder in this successor structure. Like Gilbert, she also called the Upper Midwest home. Her Boston beau, Greenleaf Norris, set up a ship supply firm in Milwaukee, and they raised a family there. Alice capably took over and ran the business years later after he fell down the stairs and broke his neck.',

            'For a brief moment, this Newark highrise was a bauble in the empire of Abraham Lefcourt, a bombastic real estate titan who slapped his name on Midtown skyscrapers long before the world ever heard of Donald Trump.\nBorn Abraham Lefkowitz, Lefcourt came to the Lower East Side with his Russian Jewish family in 1882. He made money in garment wholesaling, then put it into commercial lofts and offices. Through shrewd deals and luck, Lefcourt built a Manhattan skyscraper portfolio worth $125 million, and started boasting he would put up the world’s tallest one next. But the death in 1930 of his 17 - year - old son—two months before this highrise opened—sent Lefcourt reeling, and the stock market collapse wiped him out. He died of a heart attack two years later.\nAnother immigrant, Frank Grad, designed Lefcourt’s handsome Newark tower with its elegant details and opulent black marble and bronze entrances. Grad’s two sons joined him in the business, which steadily grew into New Jersey’s biggest architectural firm.\nThe tower, known for most of its existence as the Raymond Commerce Building, was vacant for nearly two decades before 2006, when it reopened as a luxury apartment complex. As its namesake knew, real estate can be unpredictable.',

            'Like candles on a birthday cake, 16 cement spikes once lined the rooftop of this highrise. They disappeared long ago, replaced by an electric billboard wrapped around the rooftop. Before its long-defunct Samsung sign, the tower at the entrance to L.A.’s “Miracle Mile” has also advertised beer and two insurance companies. For one TV season in 1952, before the sign went up, the building played the role of the Daily Planet newspaper in “Adventures of Superman.”\nOhio native Elihu Clement Wilson made his fortune in California’s oil business. Wilson founded a company to manufacture drilling tools, and got rich enough to buy a 124-foot motor yacht for cruises to Catalina Island. He then sold the company and commissioned his eponymous office building, erected in a rapidly developing part of town that had been forested with oil derricks only a decade earlier.\nMayor Meredith Snyder appointed Wilson to the city police commission in 1920, but soon came to regret it. Wilson turned on him the following year, publicly quitting a week before the election and accusing the mayor of covering up gambling, prostitution, and illegal alcohol sales in the City of Angels. Snyder lost his reelection bid.',

That brought the total number of guest rooms to 1,100, more than any other hospitality property on the West Coast. In case anyone wasn’t paying attention, the Harts topped their twin hotel buildings with huge electric signs emblazoned with their logo, a heart.\nThe brothers’ parents were Ohio farmers who came to Los Angeles during a speculative land boom in the 1880s. Their father managed the Natick Hotel in town, and they took over after his premature death. Later they bought an old hotel called the Rosslyn, which they would soon replace with a mammoth complex by the city’s preeminent architectural firm to handle the streams of tourists pouring into sunny southern California.\nBoth properties were linked by a marble-lined underground corridor so guests wouldn’t have to dodge traffic on Fifth Street when walking to the dining rooms or main reception desk. Converted recently into affordable housing for homeless veterans, the annex has had its lobby partially restored with its decorative metallic friezes and molding, marble reception desk, and attractive wrought iron skylight.',

            'This highrise in the showy Art Deco style known as Zigzag Moderne was constructed for real estate developer Preston Wright to house offices for doctors and dentists. The contractors who poured its concrete form also installed a terrazzo sidewalk in front that remains today.\nGaylord Wilshire, namesake of the building and the boulevard, was a land developer and an ardent socialist. The son of a rich Cincinnati banker, Wilshire purchased 35 acres of farmland west of what is now MacArthur Park and offered to give the city a strip down the middle as long as the road was named after him and permitted no train tracks or heavy trucks. Wilshire ran as a socialist for Congress three times — and for the British Parliament once while married to a Welsh woman — but was unsuccessful each time. He also founded a magazine, “The Challenge,” and a quack medical company, Ionaco, that made an electric plug-in belt Wilshire claimed could cure cancer, tuberculosis, arthritis, and a host of other ailments by magnetizing the iron in its wearer’s blood. \nThe building has been vacant for years and is tagged with graffiti. Its owner, one of Koreatown’s biggest landlords, is building an eight-story apartment complex behind it.',

            'Sprung from an international architecture competition promoted by the self-proclaimed “World’s Greatest Newspaper,” this highrise is one of the most influential skyscrapers ever constructed. That importance is not primarily due to its Rouen Cathedral-inspired design, but rather to the more than 260 contest entries that poured in from architects around the globe eager for publicity and the $100,000 prize.\nConceived by editor, publisher, and publicity pro Robert McCormick, the Chicago Tribune contest marked the public debut of several novel architectural concepts. Many felt that it missed the obvious winner, a stepped vertical massing by Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen that earned second place. Though never built, his design became a template for the waves of Art Deco skyscrapers soon to come.\nAfter city planners widened Michigan Avenue and bridged the Chicago River, stretching the thoroughfare northward, Tribune Tower became the second highrise to go up outside the Loop after the Wrigley Building, its neighbor across the street. The tower served as the newspaper\'s headquarters for nearly a century and was converted into luxury apartments in 2018.  \nVisitors in the grand lobby are surrounded by quotes from McCormick and others about the value of a free press. But an inscription on the marble floor more aptly summarizes the Tribune Tower\'s lasting contribution: "When we build, let us think that we build forever."',

            "Thirty years after Chicago curtailed its skyscrapers with a strict height limit, a 1923 zoning ordinance let towers exceed the 264-foot cutoff as long as they occupied no more than a quarter of the lot. This telescoped highrise took advantage, soon welcoming sightseers to the city's highest observation platform. Under the original plans, visitors could have waved to other sightseers on a twin tower about 100 feet away, but the second on Michigan Avenue never got past the drawing board.\nOwner Alonzo Mather, from the same family as Puritan preacher Cotton Mather, built a company that manufactured and leased railcars for transporting livestock. The well-traveled tycoon also proposed building a bridge across the Niagara River from Buffalo to Canada, with turbines suspended in the surging current underneath to supply electrical power. Permitting delays dissuaded Mather, but a bridge was eventually constructed there, flanked by a Canadian park named after him.\nOnce prized by artists, ad agencies, and design studios for its abundant natural light, the tower is now a hotel, and its marble lobby staircase gleams almost as brightly as the new cupola. Weather and wind made the original structurally unsound, so it was removed in 2000 and a replacement was plunked on via helicopter.",

An immediate success, it inspired an even bigger Chicago successor, the Merchandise Mart.\nAmerican Furniture Mart was the brainchild of Lawrence Whiting, who headed it for decades. A former football and track star at the University of Chicago, Whiting came from a banking family and served as chief personnel officer of the American Expeditionary Force in World War I. \nThe tower section, a later addition to the original structure, has been converted to residential units. Rich stonework surrounding the arched entrance gives the impression of a cathedral, but for most of its existence this building's street number was 666 — the number of the beast in the Book of Revelation. That was changed in 1988, with some claiming it was done to assuage a new major tenant, Playboy Enterprises. The magazine left in 2012, and the main building now mostly houses medical offices.",

            "To burnish their patriotism and prestige after World War I, Chicago businessmen of German descent built a skyscraper for their private club, named after the Prussian noble who trained George Washington's troops. To design their Teutonic tower, they chose a Chicago immigrant trained at the Munich Royal School of Architecture.\nClub rooms originally filled the narrow upper tower, while the bulkier lower part was mostly leaseable office space, topped with the club's exercise rooms and handball courts, a lavish two-story ballroom and main dining hall, and a skylit natatorium. Financial problems forced the club members to sell shortly after opening, and the ballroom's pipe organ was repossessed for the Black Forest village attraction of the city's 1933 World's Fair. The pool is still enjoyed by residents of the recently renovated highrise.\nLate one night in 1948, William Granata, an aspiring Republican politician who lived in the tower apartments, was found hacked to death in the revolving door. His murder was never solved, though it bore the markings of a mob hit. Granata's sister, Ursula, had been the secretary and former fiancee of \"Easy Eddy\" O'Hare, who ratted out Al Capone for income tax evasion in 1931 and was subsequently shotgunned in his car eight years later.",

            "With its shape, its sheen, and its swathes of gleaming glass, this 19th century highrise was decades ahead of its time. It was built for a high-tech entrepreneur, William Hale, who lost an office block in the Great Fire of 1871. Hale put a water tank on his next commercial property to supply firehoses in an emergency, and the water also powered the city's first hydraulic passenger elevator. Hale went on to manufacture and sell the contraptions, providing technology that made skyscrapers feasible.\nHale then commissioned his friend Daniel Burnham to draw up the Reliance Building. The office tower was for doctors and dentists, who required ample sunlight for their exam rooms, so Burnham covered two-thirds of the street-facing facade with glass. Construction took place in two stages, because tenants in the existing four-story building on the parcel had different lease terms. When the ground floor lease expired, Burnham suspended the upper three floors on jacks and built a new department store below them. When the upstairs lease ran out, a steel-framed tower arose atop the new ground floor.\nNow a hotel, the property boasts a few historically restored floors and an attractive elevator lobby with some original elements. Guests are presumably grateful that the original Hale elevators were replaced long ago.",

            'Transcontinental railroad travelers ended their westward journey not by train but by boat at this station, which handled up to 47 million passengers a year. When the 1906 earthquake struck, it stopped the 22-foot clock, but the terminal and tower survived largely intact, much to the relief of refugees forced to flee across the bay.\nNew York architect A. Page Brown snagged the job after designing a tomb for Charles Crocker, president of the Southern Pacific Railroad, which supplied most ferry traffic. Politicians worried over the bidding, and Brown\'s payment was frozen during construction; before the dispute was resolved, he died from injuries sustained after his horsecart went off a bridge.\nBridges — the Bay and the Golden Gate — also killed off ferry service. An elevated Embarcadero Freeway added insult to injury, barricading the building from Market Street. Demolition talk roused defenders like Herb Caen, who wrote: "The waterfront without the Ferry Tower would be like a birthday cake without a candle." Ironically, another earthquake essentially saved the structure — the 1989 Loma Prieta tremor so damaged the freeway that it was razed, releasing the forlorn terminal from its isolation.\nIt has since had an extensive facelift and has been reborn as a marketplace, the handsome grand nave illuminated by its original 660-foot skylight. Even the ferries have returned.',

            "When this tower debuted, its top stories housed the west coast studios of a brand new company called NBC. But its most famous tenant was fictional: Dashiell Hammett's noir gumshoe Sam Spade, whose detective agency was said to be on the fifth floor.\nThe highrise was the namesake of a short-lived Los Angeles bond house. It became 111 Sutter after its sponsors were absorbed and remains popular with investment firms. New York architects Schultze & Weaver dreamed up half a dozen luxury hotels in the same French Renaissance trappings on display here, though neither their Lexington and Sherry-Netherland hotels in Manhattan nor any of their three Biltmores boasts a copper mansard roof quite like this one, accented with a quiver of spiky spires. The richly sculpted entryway opens to a marble lobby over which loom massive painted beams.\nCrocker Bank, founded by Big Four railroad tycoon Charles Crocker, was a major tenant from the start. In 1969, the bank bought the building and announced plans to tear it down eventually in favor of a new skyscraper on the block. The skyscraper got built, but Wells Fargo swallowed up Crocker Bank before it could do any harm to this magnificent terracotta pile.",

            "The city's tallest highrise for almost three decades dons the robing of a Gothic cathedral, with arched windows, painted groined vaults in the lobby, and intricate tracery above the entrance. Its medieval motif is expressed with a more modern membrane through the use of glazed terracotta rather than stone.\nThe name comes from the parcel's first owner, Christian Russ, a German silversmith in New York whose luck seemingly ran out when his jewelry shop was robbed. Ruined, Russ enlisted in the army to fight in the Mexican-American War. He and his family boarded a ship for a tiny California outpost then called Yerba Buena, intending to start anew once hostilities ended. The conflict was brief, and then came the Gold Rush. As lucky prospectors brought their loot to San Francisco, Russ opened the town's first jewelry shop and turned their nuggets into necklaces.\nGeorge Kelham was supervising architect for the 1915 World's Fair, and the Russ Building is one of three major San Francisco skyscrapers he did in the 1920s that are clustered along a two-block stretch. The stylistic progression is clear, from the Classical carved stone of the 1922 Standard Oil Building to the Russ's terracotta Gothic to the Deco-inflected Shell Building of 1929.",

            "Colloquially known as “Mayor Mott’s wedding cake,” the first city hall to be built as a skyscraper seems almost good enough to eat, with white granite walls drizzled with terracotta icing. The matrimonial moniker originated in the mayor's surprise nuptials to a Berkeley schoolteacher while construction was underway.\nFrank Mott is best remembered for helping his city shelter 150,000 homeless San Francisco earthquake victims in 1906. The busy executive also wrested control of the waterfront and port from the railroad, expanded city parks and dredged the tidal basin known as Lake Merritt, inaugurated a civil service system, reorganized the police and fire departments, and established Oakland's first city museum.\nBesides elegant, high-ceilinged council chambers, the highrise houses courtrooms, various municipal departments and offices, a medical ward, and behind the slit windows lining the top floor beneath the clock tower, jail cells. Built of reinforced concrete to be earthquake proof, the skyscraper suffered severe seismic stress in 1989 and was retrofitted with a new steel skeleton and placed on a floating foundation. A memorial oak tree in front was planted in memory of the novelist and socialist activist Jack London, whom Mott defeated in the 1905 mayoral race.",

            "The newspaper it advertises ceased to exist, but this campanile-style tower encircled in electric orange neon remains a treasured element of the Oakland skyline. Its former owners were politicians who both turned to publishing after their reach for higher office exceeded their grasp.\nAlameda native Joseph Knowland, son of a prosperous lumber merchant, served six terms as a Republican congressman, then bought the Oakland Tribune after losing a race for senator. He relocated the paper to a six-story furniture company showroom in 1918, added the tower five years later, and began grooming his son, William, for bigger things. The younger Knowland got as far as senate majority leader, but flopped in an ill-advised run for governor in 1958. Succeeding his father as publisher, Knowland became increasingly burdened by gambling debts. In 1974, two days after commemorating the newspaper's 100th anniversary, he shot himself.\nThe elevator goes to the 20th floor, where radio station KLX once had its studios behind the clock. Up two flights of unfinished stairs is the workshop of neon light caretaker and renegade artist John Law, one of the founders of Burning Man.",

            "This office obelisk was intended as the Washington Monument of the Midwest. So said Wilbur Foshay, who apparently saw no issue with emblazoning his name in lights on a purported presidential memorial. It was one of many dubious claims made by Foshay, who went to prison four years after this highrise opened.\nAn eastern transplant who briefly managed a Kansas power company, Foshay relocated to Minneapolis and built a portfolio of small utilities, paying a fraction up front and financing the rest by issuing shares for sale to the public. As his paper empire ballooned to 30 states, he commissioned the tower and financed a blowout three-day dedication gala headlined by John Philip Sousa.\nTwo months later, the market crashed, investors were stuck with worthless stock, and the company went into receivership. Foshay was convicted of mail fraud and served three years in Leavenworth, until a letter-writing campaign by his supporters prompted a commutation from Franklin D. Roosevelt.\nThe failed businessman then brought his creative energies to Colorado, where he ran a promotional campaign claiming the mountain streams were so cold that the trout grew fur. Visitors to the tower, now a swanky hotel, can have cocktails in a mahogany-paneled lounge that was once, if only briefly, Foshay's office.",

            "Terracotta nurses survey the prairie from this highrise, revealing its medical mission and paying tribute to the women essential to its success. That includes Edith Graham, the clinic's first professional nurse and wife of Dr. Charles Mayo, who with his brother, Will, oversaw this tower for their family's storied institution.\nTheir father, William, arrived in town as a government physician to examine Union recruits for the Civil War. Later, when a tornado devastated Rochester in 1883, Mayo cared for victims with the aid of Franciscan nuns. The sisters went on to build a hospital that the doctor and his two sons staffed.\nThe practice quickly outgrew its first facility, prompting construction of this colorful addition. Great bronze doors open to a flamboyant lobby and oil painting of the brothers, whose offices upstairs are preserved as a museum. A carilloneur — the clinic's fourth since construction — plays daily concerts on the tower bells.\nIn 1954 the building was named after Dr. Henry Plummer, a thyroid specialist who designed several innovative features of the structure, including an instrument sterilization system. On the facade, a sculpted stone relief portrays Plummer poring over a blueprint. A similar tile commemorating the actual architect, Thomas Ellerbe, was never mounted.",

            'The three-sided, 50-foot illuminated logo on the roof has been out of date since the financial firm it refers to changed its name to U.S. Bancorp in a 1997 merger. Its irrelevance only heightened when the company moved out a few years later. But St. Paul maintains the iconic sign, presumably to inform Minneapolis where the older, smaller twin city sees itself in the pecking order.\nThis skyscraper originated in an earlier merger, when First National Bank of St. Paul joined forces with nextdoor neighbor Merchants National, the first bank to build a highrise on the block. A skybridge connecting the 17th floor of the new tower to the 16th of the old curiously rises instead of descending, due to differing story heights. Louis Hill, chairman of First National, wrangled the deal through deft family diplomacy; his father, Great Northern Railroad tycoon James Hill, had bought the bank in 1912 and left his eight children each an equal share.\nNews coverage at the dedication noted a basement shooting range where the private security guards could practice "the manly art of bank defense." It also marveled that every one of the uniformed women operating the elevators was exactly 5\'1" tall.',

            'When Milwaukee held a nationwide design contest for their city hall in 1891, few were surprised when the winning entry was a German Renaissance-inspired design drawn up by a German-born architect. A quarter of the population of the city known as "German Athens" were immigrants from the Fatherland, the most of any U.S. city.\nThe enormous belfry was 353 feet tall even without counting a 40-foot flagpole, meaning that, for a moment in history, Milwaukee had a highrise taller than anything in Chicago or New York. History was made again in 1910, when Emil Seidel took office here as the first Socialist mayor of a large American city.\nThis building was designed before steel framing was universal. Its load-bearing walls support their own weight, as well as the building’s most remarkable feature: seven stories of floating wrought iron walkways that hang dramatically over the tiled atrium floor.\nIntended for the simple task of getting from the stairs to the offices on each floor, the walkways became a popular spot for committing suicide during the Great Depression, prompting the city to stretch protective netting across the void in 1935. It stayed for more than 50 years, until the walkways were restored to their full vertiginous glory.',

So a federal judge padlocked the grill, and excavators had to leave the room propped on pilings for a year while they tore down everything around it to dig the foundation.\nThe flame beacon on the roof, while not original, signals the building's main purpose as utility offices and showrooms for gas appliances. The gas was not the natural kind, but rather manufactured by cooking coal. This was done at a large plant on the city's west side designed by local architect Alexander Eschweiler, who also designed iconic gas stations in the shape of Japanese pagodas. His three sons joined his firm just in time for this skyscraper project.\nA large bronze sunburst over the entrance, destroyed in an earlier remodeling, has been replaced and complements other Mayan-inspired elements. The exterior lightens as it rises, and it is not Wisconsin's famed dairy output but the pale yellow local bricks at the top that are the source of the Milwaukee moniker \"Cream City.\"",

But rather than quibble about an exaggerated floor count, pay a visit to the opulent original Chinese lounge on the 35th floor and enjoy stunning views from the outdoor observatory of Puget Sound and Mount Rainier, clouds permitting.\nIt was built by a maker of revolutionary office technology: typewriters. Lyman Smith and his brothers started out manufacturing shotguns in Syracuse, N.Y. When a competing upstate arms maker, Remington, produced the first mechanical typewriter, Smith's gunsmiths figured out an improved version with capital and lowercase letters. The company retooled its precision machining plant for peaceful purposes and later became part of Smith-Corona.\nSmith's wife, Flora, and son, Burns, visited Seattle in 1888 and were smitten, so he invested in several downtown parcels sight unseen. He finally made it out for the 1909 World's Fair, and while there announced plans to build an 18-story skyscraper. His son talked him into making it the West Coast's tallest building, which it remained until the Space Needle debuted at the 1962 World's Fair.",

            "The original promoter of this sports skyscraper skedaddled under scrutiny for questionable real estate dealings. The financier who stepped in after him to finish the job later went to prison for financial misdeeds. Neither man was as noteworthy as the local high school girl who trained in the Washington Athletic Club's sixth-floor swimming pool.\nMembers invited Helene Madison and her coach to join them even before the doors of their new highrise opened. In a brief but unprecedented career, Madison became the only athlete in history to hold every world record in a sport — 16 record women's freestyle times from 100 meters to a mile — and capped that achievement by winning three gold medals at the 1932 Olympics.\nThe pool is now named after her, and a plaque at sidewalk level honors another important woman in the club's history: Hannah Newman, the prior owner of the parcel. Her husband diplomatically had it cast to balance out a statue he commissioned in Alaska to honor another woman, a long-lost love he met during the Klondike gold rush.\nThe club's winged logo features prominently in the sculpted terracotta facade. Preserved elements inside include etched elevator doors and the original club library.",

            "It may not seem so, but this station was built on a steep hillside. The hill used to be elsewhere, however. Engineers leveled it with water cannons and used the dirt to fill in a marshy tidal flat to allow urban sprawl, including this terminal and its adjacent railyard. Excavators also bored a mile-long train tunnel under the downtown to this station to cut down on congestion.\nJames Hill, a Minnesota shipping clerk with only one functioning eye thanks to a childhood incident with an arrow, convinced investors to join him in building the first privately financed transcontinental tracks, the Great Northern Railway. Hill became one of the wealthiest Gilded Age rail barons and gained control of the Northern Pacific, one of the three original — and deeply state-subsidized — West Coast routes and his main competition for Seattle-bound traffic. \nBoth lines stopped at this station, crowned by a clock tower modeled on Venice's famed campanile. The building was designed by Hill's preferred Minnesota architects, who later produced plans for Michigan Central Station in Detroit and assisted with New York's Grand Central. Their lavishly appointed main waiting room was the victim of a midcentury mauling but has been exquisitely restored.",

            'Conceived as an Art Deco mountain, this highrise once dominated the city skyline. Its roof is capped by tapered spires meant to resemble evergreens, while its dark gray marble lobby, brightened by a gold leaf ceiling, feels like an elegant cave. Spelunk to the end to find a bronze map of the Pacific and a plaque with the founders of the insurance company that erected the building.\nOhio brothers Tasso and David Morgan came to Oregon in 1887 and started an insurance business, relocating to Seattle in 1906. They bundled health and accident policies with life insurance, a novel combination that won them many customers. Innovations persisted, including a "souvenir tower policy" commemorating this skyscraper\'s dedication that offered a triple payout if the holder died in a car crash.\nNow known as Seattle Tower, the building stands on the original site of the University of Washington, which relocated in 1895 but continues to lucratively lease its large lot, called the Metropolitan Tract. Architect Abraham Albertson came to Seattle in 1907 to supervise construction of a Beaux-Arts office and retail complex on the sprawling tract, including the Cobb Building, the earlier development\'s sole survivor, just across what is still called University Street.',

            "This highrise is one of countless hotels named for America's youngest president. Theodore Roosevelt visited Seattle in 1903 in a ceremonial flotilla, his bully pulpit bluster set at full wattage. The chief executive assured the welcoming crowd that their neighbor Alaska would eventually surpass the Scandinavian peninsula in population — a feat that would have required 7 million more Alaskans then, or 15 million now.\nSeattle semi-Scandinavian Severt Thurston, an Icelandic immigrant, headed Western Hotels, the regional chain that opened the Roosevelt in 1930. Steady growth over the following decades led to a name change, first to Western International, then the abbreviated Westin. Thurston's successor, Edward Carlson, also organized the 1962 Seattle World's Fair and inspired its centerpiece, the Space Needle.\nThat futuristic tower was the creation of architect John Graham, whose father designed this hotel. The senior Graham was prolific; the hotel was one of two Art Deco towers he contributed to Seattle's skyline in 1930, along with the Exchange Building.\nNow the boutique Hotel Theodore, the property features avant-garde lobby art and displays curated from the Museum of History and Industry. The bold decor mirrors the spirit of the original hotel, which when it opened had a coffee shop painted with scenes of life on other planets.",

            "While the legendary English navigator is believed to have landed in California during his 16th century circumnavigation of the globe, his Golden Hind never sailed through the Golden Gate. Still, Drake's name was affixed to one of San Francisco's swankiest hotels for nearly a century, until a long Covid shutdown resulted in new owners and a new name.\nThe Drake's Beefeater doorman was once the city's most photographed resident. Other men in fancy costumes performed a long-running Sunday drag brunch in the top-floor Starlight Room. But the most astonishing transformation belonged to the hotel itself. One night in 1954 while high on peyote, Allen Ginsberg saw the facade melt into \"the robot skullface of Moloch.\" The vision inspired his Beat poem \"Howl,\" which Ginsberg penned in the Drake's coffee shop.\nThe highrise was built for Fort Worth hotelier Leon Huckins, who sold it in 1938 to another Texan, Conrad Hilton, then just beginning to expand his hospitality chain outside the Lone Star State. Charles Weeks, the architect, died months before the Drake opened. Engineer William Day had years left; he built Treasure Island in the bay for San Francisco's 1939 World's Fair. One of its most heralded exhibits was a brass plate allegedly left by Drake himself on California's shores, though it was later proven to be a forgery.",

            "With this terracotta tower emblazoned inside and out with the company's signature mollusk, Royal Dutch Shell proclaimed its determination to challenge Standard Oil for control of the California oilfields. Each contestant was controlled by one of the world's richest families: Rothschilds vs. Rockefellers.\nOnly three years after opening an office in the United States, the British-Dutch conglomerate built a refinery in 1915 at Martinez, on the tidal estuary emptying into San Francisco Bay. Shell's geologists fanned out across the state seeking petroleum to fill their tankers, each ship christened with the names of various shells — Murex, Cowrie, Conch, Clam — to honor the founder's father, a London seashell merchant. In 1921 Shell hit a massive gusher at Signal Hill near Long Beach, and soon California was producing a quarter of the world's oil.\nWhen Standard moved into a new skyscraper the following year, Shell temporarily leased their rivals' former offices just across Bush Street. Next the European upstarts hired George Kelham — the same architect responsible for the Standard Oil Building — to design them a taller headquarters a block away. Eventually, with their West Coast wells sucked dry, Shell and Standard successor Chevron packed up and moved to Texas. Now new tenants occupy George Kelham's battling Bush Street highrises.",

Its architects revised their blueprints in the aftermath to add new safety features — reinforced concrete, water standpipes, and automatic doors to seal the elevator shafts from fire — while the bank commissioned six more stories in the slab behind the tower to take advantage of inflated demand for office space.\nGeorge Luchsinger, Humboldt's president during the project, was the son of one of the founders, a Swiss-born furniture maker who built a fortune manufacturing wooden rocker boxes prospectors used to sift gold from gravel. Sadly, leading his father's institution did not allay the executive's severe depression, and Luchsinger committed suicide in 1914 with his basement gas stove. Depositors panicked until the state bank examiner reassured them that their savings were secure, and Humboldt's attorney stepped in at the helm.\nThe attractive dome complemented a more famous one that used to top the Spreckels Building at the other end of the block. The rich terracotta molding of the Humboldt entryway is well preserved, as is its former banking hall, now a clothing store.",

            "Bold Mayan decorative motifs and a strikingly unique silhouette make this building a singular specimen of Art Deco's outer limits. Timothy Pflueger designed it for a dentist, Dr. Francis Morgan, who dabbled in real estate and wanted another medical and dental complex like one he had opened in Los Angeles. The T-shaped tower he got has a lobby so dazzlingly ornamented in burgundy marble, cast aluminum elevators, and gilded reverse-ziggurat ceiling and light fixtures that patients exiting might wonder if their anesthesia has truly worn off.\nAfter this project, Pflueger's affinity for the avant garde led him to lure muralist Diego Rivera to San Francisco for several commissions, including a series of giant concrete panels for the World's Fair on Treasure Island in 1940. Rivera rewarded his patron by portraying the architect and two of his skyscrapers — this one and Pacific Telephone & Telegraph — on the panels. Pflueger's theatricality also made him a natural at designing movie palaces and luxe hotel lounges.\nOne noteworthy physician who practiced at 450 Sutter was Dr. Harry Benjamin, a pioneering sexologist. Benjamin was among the first to offer hormonal treatment and surgical referrals to patients wishing to change gender, and he wrote a groundbreaking 1966 medical textbook, \"The Transsexual Phenomenon.\"",

The boast has mostly held up, with exceptions for a couple tall neighbors and the modern towers downtown blocking a few vantages towards Oakland.\nOpening his architectural practice a year before the 1906 earthquake, Herman Baumann found plenty of work. He specialized in apartments; this one, like his Gaylord Hotel in Nob Hill, places Spanish flourishes onto a stark white Deco form. The Bellaire was built for Guy Hardison, a Santa Paula citrus rancher whose father had come west from the Pennsylvania oilfields to try drilling along the Santa Clara River and struck it rich, co-founding Union Oil.\nAnother oil baron\'s son, Peter Getty, once lived in the penthouse. He sold it to his friend and business partner, then-mayor Gavin Newsom, who enjoyed the views only for a few years before moving out to begin an eventually successful quest for the governorship. Other residents who climb to the windswept roof deck for its panoramas can see the Pacific and the farthest reaches of San Francisco Bay, with the aforementioned exceptions.',

            "Once the city's most famous skyscraper, this highrise was rendered unrecognizable by a 1938 Art Deco redesign that replaced its baroque dome with a new six-story top. A lobby display of bronze doorknobs emblazoned with \"CS” are the only clue to its former identity as the Claus Spreckels Building.\nThe German immigrant ran a grocery store and a brewery before opening a sugar refinery. With relentless focus, Spreckels built an empire of cane plantations in Hawaii, beet fields in California, factories, ships, and railroads to supply West Coast tables with sugar.\nWhen the San Francisco Chronicle alleged stock fraud, Spreckels's outraged son Adolph burst into its newsroom and shot the editor, Michael de Young. The victim survived, the assailant got away with a temporary insanity plea, and the rivalry intensified. Spreckels bought the San Francisco Call and built it a new headquarters overshadowing the Chronicle building across the street.\nThe Call's tower rode out the 1906 earthquake intact but gutted by fire. It was restored and the presses rolled again, but Spreckels's oldest son, John, preferred San Diego and eventually sold the paper to Michael de Young. Adolph and his wife, Alma, avenged the family honor by building an art museum to dwarf de Young's, but he parried with an expansion; today cooler heads have combined the two institutions.",

            "It seemed like a good idea at the time, combining four city Methodist Episcopal congregations into one new church with an attached hotel whose patrons would pay off its construction debt. Rev. Walter Sherman persuaded his flock, at any rate. They named the hostelry after a missionary who established their faith's first congregation in San Francisco.\nWorshipers filled the 1,500-seat sanctuary for its first service on Easter Sunday in 1930 to hear Sherman's sermon. But financial problems swiftly arose, leading to foreclosure. Other hoteliers entered the picture, relaunching as the Empire Hotel and converting the upper floor to a cocktail lounge. Their efforts also foundered, so they sold it to the federal government to billet draftees during World War II. The church's gothic vaults were later concealed with a drop ceiling and the space became an IRS office.\nThe worship space is now unused, but the building has been a dormitory for students at the nearby law school since 1981. Originally named after its founder, Serranus Hastings, the first chief justice of the California Supreme Court, the institution recently changed its name after historians uncovered how Hastings backed a bloody campaign by Mendocino County settlers against the resident Yuki people.",

Despite a lack of formal training, Timothy Pflueger rose rapidly from apprentice draftsman to junior partner at his mentor's firm before the pair won this commission. It was briefly the city's tallest highrise until the Russ Building surpassed it by mere inches. \nA newspaper poet dubbed the new phone company headquarters \"a shimmery, gleaming monument to Talk!\" For George McFarlane, president of Pacific Telephone & Telegraph, the California subsidiary of AT&T, fawning poetry was far preferable to the ugly headlines his company had endured in its rocky recent history. Besides labor unrest and recurring strikes by its linemen and operators, Pacific was the main culprit in a 1906 city hall bribery scandal that got the mayor's right-hand man sentenced to 14 years in San Quentin.\nNow the headquarters of numerous high-tech companies, the building stood vacant for several years after the phone company left. Luckily, Pflueger's spectacular lobby has survived in nearly pristine condition, with its black mottled marble walls, lacquered multicolor trim, and orange ceiling embossed with Chinese animal prints.",

Harrison headed the bridge\'s finance committee during its construction and served as the master of ceremonies in 1936 for its dedication, when the governor, instead of cutting a ribbon, severed a golden chain with an acetylene torch.\nTerracotta trim at the base features eagles, shields emblazoned with "FCB," and a pair of rams glowering over the entryway. The modern massing and lines of the exterior transition to wrought-iron railings and a bronze decorative motif of Romans in profile in the two-story marble lobby. Architects Walter Reed and William Corlett would more fully commit to Art Deco in their next project, a ziggurat-like Palo Alto hospital known as Hoover Pavilion.',

        description:
            "Depending on the wind, the duck on this highrise's weathervane might either be taking off or preparing to land at nearby Lake Merritt. The former tidal marsh that became a city centerpiece was created by and named after Dr. James Merritt, former mayor and a founder of the bank, which is Alameda County's oldest.\nA Massachusetts surgeon, Merritt came to San Francisco to get rich and did so almost despite himself. His first scheme was to send a ship to get ice from the Pacific Northwest. When the crew discovered ponds didn't freeze thick there as they do in New England, they returned with a load of lumber, which found a ready market. The physician's second planned venture was to import coal from Australia, but his shipmaster instead brought oranges from Tahiti, correctly guessing they would be far more profitable.\nMerritt bought extensive property in Oakland, and as its mayor pushed a plan to dam the estuary, turning it from a public sewer to a scenic haven for migratory waterfowl. He persuaded the state to ban hunting around it, creating the first government-owned wildlife refuge in the United States.\nThe tower was an addition to the adjoining eight-story bank. Its interior has intricate restored plaster coffered ceilings and lovely decorative pilasters in the lobby stairwell.",
