        "description": "Planned as the world’s tallest building when construction commenced in 1871, the tower was usurped by the Washington Monument and Eiffel Tower before its completion. Alexander Milne Calder’s 37-foot bronze William Penn is the tallest statue on any building anywhere, double the size of the Statue of Freedom on the U.S. Capitol.\nThat dome’s designer, Thomas Walker, came out of retirement to help architect John McArthur Jr. with this monumental edifice. Neither man lived to see their work completed. Calder, who crafted 250 sculptures for city hall and was there in 1894 to see his 27-ton Penn hoisted to its apex, despaired that the founder was installed looking north, which leaves his face perpetually in shadow.\nThe tower is built of load-bearing brick walls sheathed in marble and rests on 22-foot-thick granite walls at its base. Above the four clocks, marble gives way to white painted steel, a replacement of the original cast iron.\nBesides the internal clockwork and two extravagant mayoral and council rooms, the tower is basically empty but for a staircase and small, slow elevator to take passengers to the viewing deck. An unwritten agreement that kept Penn’s hat the tallest point in the city was finally broken in 1987.",

Ads when it opened promised “Park your car under your desk!” Office tenants included investment brokers, insurance firms, the Philadelphia Grand Opera and the local office for Cunard White Star ocean liners.\nThe powerfully wealthy but publicity-shy Pew family took the penthouse as their pied-à-terre, since it was conveniently located next door to the headquarters of their family business, Sun Oil Company, also known as Sunoco.\nPhiladelphia architects Tilden, Register & Pepper won an award for their design at the 12th International Buildings Congress in Budapest, Hungary. Their spectacular Art Deco lobby features a ceiling of contoured geometric patterns, futuristic chandeliers, mottled tan marble walls, a patterned terrazzo floor, and elegant aluminum trim and elevator doors.\nThe building served as the home of Temple University Center City from the 1970s until 2001. Now it contains luxury apartments, and residents have access to the Pews’ former rooftop sundeck.",

        "description": "As the name implies, this tower provided offices for architects. It also was designed by them, as 20 firms participated in a committee headed by John Hall Rankin, respected dean of the field and former president of the local chapter of the American Institute of Architects.\nShortly after the building opened, the AIA held a public exhibition showcasing the work of several members who now occupied offices upstairs. Paul Cret, for instance, displayed photos of his Rodin Museum on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, recently dedicated and containing one of the most extensive collections of the Paris sculptor’s work. The AIA relocated in 2008, but its library on the top floor has been preserved as it once appeared.\nThe building, now the Hotel Palomar, has a sleek Art Deco exterior with handsome bronze panels and patterned brickwork testifying that the architects knew what they were doing. Best of all is the historic second floor elevator lobby, which combines vibrant tilework and carved wood with a dramatically coffered plaster ceiling and Welsh quarry tile floor.",

The bell first rang on New Year’s Day 1927 from a tower on his great department store, but was soon relocated to the belfry of this skyscraper, the first seven floors of which purveyed a tasteful array of tailored suits, fashionable overcoats, hunting costumes and sporting goods for the discerning gentleman.\nA pair of much-admired 1890s skyscrapers had to be torn down to make way for the new construction, so its original appellation name-checked them both in order to assuage any hard feelings.\nAfter Philadelphia National Bank bought the tower, four sets of its illuminated initials “PNB” perched atop the belfry for nearly 60 years. They were finally removed by cargo helicopter in 2014 from the building now known as One South Broad, and one huge “B” was rehung in the lobby.",

        "description": "The contours of this slab skyscraper are Art Deco, but slathered on top is an icing of terracotta and tiled rooftops and gazebos seemingly transplanted from Seville or Southern California. Developers named the luxury residential highrise for a celebrated English privateer who looted goodly sums of Spanish booty while claiming the Pacific coast for Queen Elizabeth I.\nArchitects Ritter & Shay also designed Market Street National Bank, a cousin to the Drake that features ornamentation more strictly Deco though no less exuberant. With 300 apartments and a cluster of penthouses, the Drake touted true high society city living.\nIn the 1970s, owners Stanton and Robert Miller ran high stakes bingo games in the ballroom five nights a week — allegedly for charity, in reality for their pockets. Unlike Sir Francis Drake, the Millers wound up sentenced to prison for their ill-gotten gains, and the property suffered through bankruptcy and other ignominies until its eventual renovation.\nThe two-story penthouse on top affords breathtaking views from its twin patios, but not from the red-roofed dome, which just hides a water tank.",

The paper needed 800 tons of it per week; storage rooms held 200 railcars worth.\nElverson and his wife, Eleanore, a former actress, lived in apartments upstairs until he died of a heart attack in 1929 while planning festivities for the paper’s 100th anniversary. The tower’s four 16-foot clocks are accompanied by Westminster chimes; Elverson loved clocks and kept a collection of rare timepieces.\nThe Inquirer won 17 Pulitzers in its heyday from 1975 to 1990 before departing the premises in 2012. Plans to make the building into a casino were abandoned, and instead the granite and ivory terracotta highrise has been repurposed as police headquarters.",

        "description": "Stephen Girard was one of the richest banking tycoons in American history, so the Philadelphian’s name held a natural appeal for financial institutions. The Girard Life Insurance, Annuity and Trust Company, formed five years after its namesake’s death, erected one of the city’s first highrises on the northeast corner of Broad and Chestnut.\nIn 1908, the truncated Girard Trust fittingly relocated to shorter headquarters — a two-story domed marble temple they built across the street. Eventually outgrowing that, they brought in the country’s preeminent architectural firm to design this tower, a marble-sheathed Neoclassical extension of their pantheon replica. A third skyscraper built next door in 1973, initially called Three Girard and later One Meridian Plaza, had to be demolished after it was gutted by a fire that also shut down the older highrise.\nIn 2000, the two marble Girard buildings reopened as a Ritz-Carlton, the city’s third. The first one still stands two blocks south on Broad Street; its owner built it out of spite when his wife was reprimanded for lighting a cigarette in the Bellevue-Stratford.",

Today’s grandiose dining room, with its 24-foot-high painted beam ceilings and square columns of red marble, was originally made for a bank.\nFounded by private financier Jay Cooke, the First National Bank of Philadelphia, as its name attests, was literally the first financial institution in the country chartered to print banknotes backed by the U.S. Treasury. Cooke was a private financier who loaned Pennsylvania $3 million to fund its Civil War efforts. He successfully lobbied President Abraham Lincoln and Congress to replace the country’s chaotic hodgepodge of state-run banks, establishing the banking system that exists to this day.\nLivingston Jones, First National president when this office opened, and his wife, Edith, were outdoorsy types who enjoyed canoe trips in Canada. Their daughter Cornelia became a Chestnut Hill sensation, becoming a pilot at 17 and competing in air races and shows.",

        "description": "This concrete and steel office highrise with its stark bright cladding was added to an existing 16-story building on 15th Street that covers its lower floors with a far more staid Neoclassical facade. Its architect, Staten Island native Arthur Hall, designed army posts across the country during World War I, then came to Philadelphia, where he drew up the plans of at least two other skyscrapers and a number of Main Line homes.\nDeveloper Richard Seltzer put a gymnasium with squash and handball courts halfway up the slender skyscraper so office tenants had a convenient place to exercise. In 1960 the Penthouse restaurant and cocktail lounge opened on the top floor, offering patrons spectacular city views with their nightcaps.\nLewis Tower was purchased in 2004 for conversion into condominiums, but things got complicated the following year, when a piece of stone veneer broke off and crashed through the roof of the restaurant next door, prompting city officials to close the building. Now fully repaired and renovated, it has been redubbed the Aria.",

Later jobs besides the Equitable Building included the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Free Library of Philadelphia.\nWithin a year of its opening, this became the headquarters of the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company and its powerful and visionary boss, Thomas Mitten. Mitten took the top floor for his management business and leased 12 floors for the transit company, putting bus waiting rooms and ticket offices on the ground floor along with his bank and securities company, which then acquired the property and renamed it the Mitten Building. Two years later, the city sued Mitten for alleged financial scams, and soon afterward his drowned body was discovered in a fishing pond on his Poconos estate.\nA theater next door on Broad Street had its main lobby in the Equitable Building; its marquee still hangs over the Locust Street sidewalk, though the theater is now a parking garage and the lobby is a restaurant.",

        "description": "With his city in the midst of a highrise boom, James Willcox, president of the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society, felt his institution’s planned new office tower had to make a statement to attract new tenants. Thus America got its first International Style skyscraper, a cubist masterpiece of polished granite, limestone, glass, and brick.\nInside and out, it emphasizes what architect George Howe called “the beautiful surfaces of machine production,” relying on simple geometric forms and lines for its appeal. Escalators brought customers to the banking hall on the second floor, a vast open space where ranks of boxy marble columns rise 30 feet to the ceiling and support the building above.\nThis was one of the first fully air conditioned office towers, and its trademark rooftop sign hides the cooling machinery. The TV tower is not original, added in 1948.\nFurniture and fixtures were custom designed by the architects to complement their bold design, and main interior spaces have been meticulously preserved. The building is now a hotel, and guests seeking out the former boardroom on the 33rd floor can enjoy a sweeping panorama from Fairmount Park to the Delaware River.",

        "description": "The finery of a Loire Valley château was draped over a steel frame to create this early Philadelphia highrise. It was erected for the American Baptist Publication Society, which for years had printed and sold religious tracts and Bibles at its offices here, maintained a library, and coordinated various charitable causes until an 1896 fire destroyed it all.\nThe new building’s French style obviously curtsies to Philadelphia City Hall, while its name honors the society’s former president, John Crozer, a wealthy textile manufacturer and dedicated philanthropist. The building opened in time for Christmas in 1897, and visitors marveled at its finely appointed bookstore with oak cabinetry, cushioned settees for browsing, and a dainty reading room for women. \nThe lecture hall upstairs seated 600 guests, with high ceilings painted in allegorical frescoes. The exterior has suffered a bit since then, losing its original street-level façade and a sumptuous balcony railing that once stretched just below the steep mansard roof. But it still provides elegant quarters for the aspiring electricians who study at the charter trade school now located here.",

        "description": "A rich marble staircase worn by a century of shoe leather leads from the sidewalk entrance to what was originally a brightly sunlit banking floor. Now an appealing modern hotel lobby, it still preserves Liberty Title & Trust’s original marble tiled floors, elaborate crown molding and wall medallions, and a bronze elevator that accessed the old safety deposit boxes, which are now stacked on a giant bookcase for atmosphere.\nArchitect Frederic Hirons liked to blend old and new motifs too, both here and in his Beaux-Arts Institute of Design in Manhattan, which opened shortly after this building did. In digging the foundations, builders discovered a buried creek feeding the Schuylkill River. They spent months pumping out millions of gallons of water to stabilize the soggy soil; appropriately, years later, the highrise housed the city water department. \nThis was the only building on the block spared when the convention center expanded to Broad Street. That was because the authority intended to put their headquarters here, but as costs ballooned, officials had to abandon their plan.",

The financial institution’s rapid success led to construction of Uptown’s first skyscraper, called the National Bank of North Philadelphia Building.\nBeury, meanwhile, had new presidential obligations. An influential trustee at nearby Temple University, he was picked for the executive job following the death of the institution’s founder. Refocused on the university, Beury remained the bank’s chairman until it was acquired by Bankers Trust Company in 1930. The successors renamed the building after him in September, then three months later became the first large Philadelphia bank to fail in the Great Depression.\nBeury guided Temple’s steady growth in his 15 years as president, and a building on campus also bears his name. His once-stylish Art Deco tower on Broad Street long stood abandoned, crumbling, and infamously adorned by a pair of graffiti artists who proudly tagged it with their noms-de-can: “Forever” and “Boner.” After decades of neglect, it is being renovated into a hotel.",

        "description": "Ever since Ben Franklin flew his famous kite, electricity has played a key role in the City of Brotherly Love. On New Year’s Eve 1927, Thomas Edison himself sent a telegraph message to this new office tower named in his honor and owned by Philadelphia Electric Company.\nOn the elderly inventor’s signal, keyed from his home in Menlo Park, 483 floodlights flicked on to bathe the upper floors of the Edison in a rainbow of nighttime illumination. Behind the new skyscraper on Sansom Street was a six-story coal-fired electrical station Edison’s company had built in 1888, before mergers consolidated the city’s power businesses.\nArchitect John T. Windrim designed several power plants, including an immense Beaux-Arts station on the Delaware River in Chester, and went on to design the Lincoln-Liberty Building. His bold diamond patterns in the ground-level brickwork subtly repeat near the top. They are eclipsed, however, by the building’s latest light display, an illuminated sign for Thomas Jefferson University, which acquired the property in 1973.\nThe smokestack rises from a power plant next door that stands on the footprint of Edison’s original generating station.",

        "description": "When John Bowman became chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh in 1921, he proposed a bold plan for his growing institution: a college skyscraper. Philadelphia architect Charles Klauder, renowned for his campus buildings at Princeton and Cornell, designed the tower as a blend of Art Deco and his signature Collegiate Gothic style.\nGround was broken in 1926, and the first classes were held in the building in 1931, though the Great Depression delayed completion of the dramatic four-story Commons Room for six more years.\nThe 40-story limestone highrise was the tallest educational building in the world until Moscow State University surpassed it in 1953. The university subsequently boasted having the tallest such building \"in the free world,\" until the Cathedral of Learning was supplanted by school skyscrapers in Japan and Spain.\nAt the time of construction, surveys showed that one of every three Pitt students was the child of an immigrant. To honor that heritage, the university invited Pittsburgh’s various ethnic organizations to design and fund 18 Nationality Rooms representing the mother countries. Students taking classes in the rooms, which now number 31, quickly learn to expect occasional interruptions by curious visitors peeking in the doorways.",

        "description": "Heinrich Koppers of Germany developed an efficient industrial oven for producing coke, the essential fuel for iron and steel furnaces, while also capturing gas and tar byproducts for other uses. That interested U.S. Steel, so Koppers formed a Chicago company in 1907 to supply the American steel industry.\nFinancier Andrew Mellon soon acquired a controlling stake and moved the company to Pittsburgh. During World War I, he forced the German founder out entirely, and soon thereafter became Secretary of the Treasury.\nGraham, Anderson, Probst & White designed the company’s Art Deco headquarters with a polished granite and limestone exterior and a chateau-style roof made of – what else – copper. It was briefly the city’s tallest skyscraper until overshadowed by the Gulf Building across the street, the headquarters of another company in the Mellon portfolio.\nKoppers grew into a sprawling industrial conglomerate until a 1988 British hostile takeover led to the sale of several divisions. Managers bought the chemicals business, which is still based in the skyscraper. The building’s three-story marble lobby with bronze accents has been extensively restored.",

        "description": "After Thomas Keenan made a fortune selling his newspaper, the Pittsburgh Press, he commissioned the first skyscraper on Liberty Avenue. Its signature flourish, a cast concrete baroque dome, was inspired by an even more elaborate dome capping the headquarters of the San Francisco Call.\nThe Keenan dome was originally gold, not red, and was crowned by a large globe and eagle. First to move in under the golden dome was a photography studio, then for decades the uppermost stories housed a school for women.\nKeenan crusaded against civic corruption and vice; that, along with his bachelor status, may explain false rumors that he lived in a penthouse under the dome and used it for trysts. Today the space is a community room for residents of what is now called Midtown Towers. It has been extensively remodeled after a 2017 fire.\nTen bas-reliefs at sidewalk level honor important public figures including city namesake William Pitt, philanthropist Mary Schenley, and H.D.W. English, president of the chamber of commerce, which moved its offices here when the building opened.",

        "description": "Like a bizarre lighthouse shining over the harbor, this showy brick replica of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, Italy, was once crowned with a revolving, illuminated 50-foot tall bottle of the Emerson Drug Company’s signature hangover cure.\nThat massive beacon caused cracks in the tower and had to come down in 1936. But the dozen letters spelling Bromo-Seltzer that replace traditional numerals on the clocks indicate how far Isaac Emerson was willing to go to flog his product.\nThe former drugstore proprietor invented a fizzy elixir to treat headaches and indigestion, and encouraged its widespread adoption by other druggists through offers of company stock in exchange for high sales volume. The powder was packaged in attractive blue glass bottles, samples of which are displayed in a quaint museum on the top floor.\nEmerson’s factory is gone, but the tower it was attached to was given to the city when the drug company left town. Too skinny for offices — two-thirds of each floor is used up by the elevator, stairs, and landing — it has been converted into loft space for artists.",

Its interior is equally breathtaking, with multicolored marble columns supporting the painted beamed ceiling and four large murals depicting the city in each century of its existence.\nAlas, the lovely hand-wrought iron gates by master blacksmith Samuel Yellin now bar the public from the former banking hall, which has been repurposed as a gym. Its spectacular mosaic floor by the acclaimed muralist Hildreth Meière — creator of Radio City Music Hall’s signature sculptures — is covered with mats to protect it.\nOnce the state’s biggest financial institution, Baltimore Trust did not survive the 1933 banking panic. Now a residential highrise, the building has changed hands and names repeatedly. Its most colorful owner, West Virginia millionaire and political gadfly Raymond J. Funkhouser, renamed it the O’Sullivan building in 1942 after a company he owned that made rubber shoe heels. He also kicked an upscale barbershop out of the top floor so he could put his penthouse there.",

Some say it represents maple seedpods or bat wings, others say a screwdriver or an arrowhead shattered by the city’s brutal winters.\nArchitect Ralph Walker, who helped to establish the canon for Art Deco skyscrapers with his Barclay-Vesey and Irving Trust buildings in Manhattan, said he wanted to convey a sense of flight and was inspired by seashells he found on the beach in Florida. Hailed by the American Institute of Architects in 1957 as “architect of the century,” Walker later resigned from the organization over an ethics controversy. He committed suicide at the age of 83, rumor has it with a silver bullet he forged for himself.\nThe bank moved out after a 1955 merger, and the new owner redubbed this the Times Square Building after the former name of the intersection where it stands. A dramatic red marble lobby still features the original chandelier. Stylized bas-reliefs over the front windows by New York sculptor Leo Friedlander depict two Greek goddesses representing security and trust.",

Instead they turned to John Wade, an opinionated local designer who produced one of the most spectacular Art Deco highrises ever constructed.\nThe elegantly stepped sandstone mass features stylized carvings and polychromatic terracotta in geometric Native American motifs. A frieze over the entrance depicts the city writing her future, surrounded by stevedores, ironworkers, and research chemists; the rear frieze showcases key historic episodes. In the lobby are vivid, almost comic book murals of musclebound men and gleaming women by William de Leftwich Dodge, whose work also decorates the Library of Congress and the New York State Capitol.\nBuffalo’s councilmen could not agree on which citizens to honor in their 13th floor chambers. So instead, identical busts represent various virtues, lit by a large stained glass skylight of the rising sun.Visitors to the free observatory on the top floor can take in the sprawling cityscape, Lake Erie, and distant Niagara Falls.\nA park in front has an obelisk to President William McKinley, assassinated in Buffalo in 1901. Bronze statues of the two presidents who hailed from the city, Millard Fillmore and Grover Cleveland, are the site’s sole concession to mediocrity.",

        "description": "If the 40-foot spire atop the Rand Building was originally intended as a mooring mast for zeppelins, as is sometimes claimed, that plan never got off the ground. But searchlights and red neon made the spire a helpful beacon for airplanes in the days before radar, and it still blinks at night today.\nIt is a sobering tribute to the building’s namesake, George Rand Sr., who died in a plane crash in England in 1919. Rand was president of Marine Trust, one of the state’s largest banks. He was returning from Paris, where Rand had offered the French prime minister a large private sum to fund a new war memorial.\nGeorge Rand Jr. soon succeeded his father and oversaw planning of this new headquarters for the bank, which was the city’s tallest skyscraper for more than 40 years. The 18th floor housed the studios of radio station WGR, whose call letters also commemorate George Rand.\nThis was the sole skyscraper designed by Franklyn and William Kidd, who immigrated with their parents from Scotland. Franklyn designed a mansion for the Rands in 1918, which helped him to land this commission.",

        "description": "The back-to-back Statues of Liberty facing east and west from this rooftop signify Buffalo’s importance as a water transport nexus on the Erie Canal. They were designed by Italian immigrant sculptor Leo Lentelli, who had gazed upon the much larger original when he sailed into New York harbor.\nThe financial institution that erected this skyscraper was founded in 1882 for immigrants as the German American Bank. America’s entry into World War I prompted a name change in 1918 which, besides being patriotic, was a shrewd marketing scheme. The U.S. government was heavily promoting war bonds, and the renamed institution took out ads urging: “Buy your Liberty Bonds at the Liberty Bank.”\nArchitect Alfred Bossom was an immigrant too. After a career in New York designing skyscrapers, he returned to England, served in Parliament for 28 years, and became a mentor to Margaret Thatcher, the future prime minister.\nThe lobby has extraordinary coffered ceilings and a carved marble version of the rooftop statues in a niche behind the security desk. The statues are modeled on the bank logo, a modernized version of Lady Liberty with short hair and an athletic build.",

        "description": "By placing its new passenger terminal nearly three miles outside of downtown Buffalo, the New York Central Railroad demonstrated its optimism about the city’s growth prospects. Unfortunately, that optimism proved to be unwarranted. Buffalo’s urban core failed to expand here, and even if it had, the age of the automobile spelled the end of passenger rail.\nThe facility was designed to handle 200 trains and 10,000 people daily, with an attached office skyscraper whose lobby also served as the main entrance to the station. Alfred Fellheimer was a railway terminal expert and the lead architect of Grand Central Station in New York; his firm also designed Cincinnati’s train station, considered an Art Deco masterpiece, at roughly the same time as this one.\nThe last train chugged out Buffalo station in 1979, and weeds now grow over its disused platforms. The property badly deteriorated under subsequent owners, a victim of weather, vandalism, and arson. Preservationists bought it in 1997 for one dollar plus back taxes. They restored the tower clocks and the main concourse, and recently released a master plan for renovating the rest of the abandoned complex.",

        "description": "To celebrate its pioneering power grid supplied by turbines at Niagara Falls, Buffalo erected a temporary 391-foot Electric Tower at its 1901 World’s Fair. Buffalo General Electric supplied current to light the hundreds of bulbs that festooned it, and a decade later the company commissioned a smaller version of the tower for its own offices.\nThis was designed by local architects August Esenwein and James Johnson, who had done several buildings for the fair, though not the original tower. In addition to offices, the new building had a product showroom and a transformer station in the basement. At the summit was an auditorium for company meetings and a public observation deck and searchlights that could be seen more than 50 miles away.\nA few elements of the exterior have been lost over the years, such as a sculpture of two youths admiring a dynamo. The tower housed power company offices for most of its existence, much of it under the name of parent corporation Niagara Mohawk after a 1950 consolidation. It was sold to an independent developer in 2004, and the lobby has been substantially restored from earlier remodeling.",

        "description": "“Harmony without dullness” is how architect Henry Churchill summarized this office highrise, still the tallest building in central New York. Besides its bold terracotta accent panels, the bricks get lighter the higher they go, adding an illusion of sunlight even on gloomy days. Inside, the elevator lobby is a controlled riot of geometric designs.\nBuilt for New York developer Albert Meyer, the tower was the fruit of a creative if short-lived partnership between Churchill and Stuart Thompson. In their home base of Manhattan, their Lowell Hotel still has a lush pink tiled entrance, and their Bauhaus-style glass box loft was one of very few American buildings included in the 1932 Museum of Modern Art exhibition that defined the International Style.\nThe skyscraper stands on the site of a prior office block destroyed in a 1923 fire that killed three people and triggered a new city requirement for sprinklers. A 1962 gas explosion was strong enough to buckle the State Tower Building’s basement walls, but fortunately caused only a few injuries. The property has undergone recent renovations and now has apartments in its upper floors.",

One wonders if Clarence Hills, the real estate broker who commissioned and named the highrise, intended some sort of statement.\nThe building’s designer, Melvin King, swept floors as an apprentice for prominent Syracuse architect Archimedes Russell until securing paid employment. He ultimately became partner, was lead designer of the nearby 1906 Beaux-Arts county courthouse, and went on to create a gleaming Art Deco tour-de-force five blocks away, the Niagara Hudson Building. King eventually turned the business over to his son and nephew; King & King is now New York’s oldest continuously operating architectural firm.\nCarved ornamental columns in the Hills Building’s granite base attractively frame its entrance arch. A small but elegant lobby features gilded beams and ribs supporting a vaulted ceiling, ornamental grapevine crown molding, terrazzo floors, and contrasting marble in mottled beige and streaked ebony.",

        "description": "Chartered in 1849, the Syracuse Savings Bank was the first bank to open in a city that was then only a year old. By 1874 the institution needed new headquarters and announced a design competition. The winning entry came from Joseph Silsbee, a recent graduate of the nation’s first school of architecture at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nVisitors thrilled to ride in the city’s first elevator for views from the top of the tower, where Silsbee put his office. He helped to establish Syracuse University’s architecture department, prospered with more commissions, and eventually relocated to Chicago. But this steep-gabled sandstone edifice is still considered Silbee’s masterpiece, a textbook example of High Victorian Gothic. Preservationists in the 1960s made it a centerpiece in their fight against unbridled urban redevelopment. \nThe bank once stood over the Erie Canal, which ran through downtown Syracuse until it was filled in during the 1920s to become Erie Avenue. The impressive banking room is still in use and has the original beamed ceilings and extensive gothic trimmings. The main block’s top three floors were recently remodeled into luxury apartments. A carillon once chimed in the tower but has been silent for decades.",

The designer quit when his independent post of state architect was subsumed under the public works department.\nBut its champion, Al Smith, four-term governor of New York, pressed relentlessly for a tower to house Albany’s scattered state workforce. Smith oversaw planning and even manned the steam shovel at the groundbreaking. Then, with construction underway, he ran for president against Herbert Hoover and lost in a landslide.\nHis gubernatorial successor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, won the White House four years later. Smith exited politics to head the corporation that raised the Empire State Building. Months after his death in 1945, legislators renamed the state office tower in Smith’s honor. Today it stands above the State Capitol and Empire State Plaza like an Art Deco transition from the Gilded Age to the Space Age.\nThe lobby ceiling is painted with murals of important New Yorkers, and all 62 counties have their names carved into the facade. Ten important ones get a big font treatment — but not the neglected Bronx, small and nearly hidden on the side of the entrance.",

        "description": "Most of this building is actually an addition. The left side was the original 10-story skyscraper, designed by Marcus Reynolds, a prominent and well-connected local architect. Two decades later in 1922, the bank brought back Reynolds for a major expansion project that added six more window bays and the central clock tower, plus a large addition in the rear.\nReynolds, who designed numerous Albany landmarks including the castle-like Delaware and Hudson Building and the domed Albany Trust Building, had his offices in this highrise. So did the Thachers, an industrial and political dynasty who ran the bank and a railcar wheel works and could boast of three members elected mayor of the city between 1860 and 1940.\nThe main hall in the middle, once used for banking, is now used for banqueting. Marble pillars with gilded capitals soar above the potted palms, supporting a dramatic vaulted ceiling. The original side has a metallic coffered ceiling and a bronze arched doorway leading into the event space. Passersby are likely unaware that one pair of winged lions leering down at them from above is considerably younger than the pair a few steps up the sidewalk.",

Between and below them are stylized flowers and other decorations in deep blue, yellow, and ocher.\nThe panels are by Rene Chambellan, a leading Art Deco architectural sculptor. His work also embellishes the State Office Tower in town, as well as more famous skyscrapers including the American Radiator Building in Manhattan, Tribune Tower in Chicago, and Buffalo City Hall. The spiraling foliage motif repeats in carvings below on the granite base of the structure and on the ceiling inside the former banking hall, now used for wedding receptions and galas.\nThe financial institution that paid for this highrise boasted in ads that it was “Albany’s most beautiful savings bank.” An elegant scroll and wreath in low relief on the facade below the bank’s carved name commemorates its founding in 1871. Beneath that are additional profiles of the original residents of the region, interspersed with their noisy new neighbors.",

        "description": "This former railroad terminal was inspired by the Cloth Hall in Ypres, a Flemish Gothic landmark badly damaged in World War I just as this homage was being constructed in Albany. Delaware and Hudson, which began as a canal bringing barges from the Scranton coalfields to New York, was one of six rail lines serving the state capital. Its new offices were devised to block the view from State Street of unsightly railyards and steamer docks at the riverfront.\nA more romantic explanation is sometimes proffered: that the building marks the spot where Henry Hudson forlornly came ashore in his failed search for a fabled Northwest Passage to the Pacific Ocean. His ship, Half Moon, spins on the rooftop weathervane.\nThe State University of New York purchased the complex in 1972 to convert into the main administration offices for its more than 60 campuses. Arcaded main hallways with vaulted tile ceilings are the last original interiors. Luxurious former apartments of a newspaper publisher and political boss at the south end of the complex used to be offered to SUNY chancellors, but they have been converted into office space.",

        "description": "This tall office in glazed terracotta seems tasteful, graceful, and deliberately unobtrusive so as not to steal the spotlight from its celebrated neighbor across the street, the New York State Capitol. That was surely deliberate: Paul Gmelin, the German-born architect who drew it up, worked for a New York firm founded by the son of Leopold Eidlitz, one of the architects who worked on the capitol.\nAlbany was an early adopter of telecommunications technology. One year after Alexander Graham Bell won the gold medal for his invention at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, the city became the first to get phones for its police department, hooking up a set for the chief with one at each precinct house and another for the mayor.\nDemand only grew, eventually requiring this local administrative headquarters and exchange for New York Telephone. A decade later, the architect was called back to expand the building the full length of the block. It doubled in size again in the 1960s, this time with a modern appearance meant to blend with its new neighbor, Empire State Plaza. It remains a telephone administrative office building to this day.",

        "description": "The 1920s design revolution known as Art Deco took some interesting turns, including a brief fascination with Mayan motifs such as the painted friezes on this highrise. Buffalo architect James Johnson intended them to offset the stark verticality of what was the tallest skyscraper on the American side of Niagara Falls for almost 80 years.\nIt was constructed as the main headquarters of United Hotels, a luxury chain created by lawyer and entrepreneur Frank Dudley. Dudley helped to form several local ventures including a trolley company, an electric utility, and the city’s first country club. He also developed the city’s upscale Lewiston Heights neighborhood, where James designed a mansion for Dudley and his wife, Harriet.\nUnited was one of the era’s biggest hotel chains, with properties in the United States, Canada, and overseas. A flagship was the Niagara Hotel across the street, which has been vacant for several years. So was this highrise until it was renovated and reopened as a boutique hotel and apartment complex. The top story is now an observation room where guests can watch the river hurl itself over the escarpment to become the American Falls.",

In addition to more than 300 students, the towering dormitory also houses the chancellor of the institution in its two-story penthouse.\nThough not as prominent as Newark-based competitor Prudential, American Insurance Company was founded decades before the more famous firm. Father and son architects John and Wilson Ely, who designed Newark City Hall, drew up this building and the nearby Newark & Essex Building at about the same time. Both buildings were erected contemporaneously, and both were delayed simultaneously by an ironworker strike.\nAmerican Insurance was acquired in 1963 and its staff relocated to the suburbs a decade later. Rutgers turned the building into its law school in 1979, a bit too late for Professor Ginsburg, who had moved on to teach at Columbia by then. When the law school got a new home in 1999, this highrise stood vacant for more than a decade until converted to student housing.

Though its shape is similar to other Art Deco towers of its time, in its ornamentation the highrise is decidedly Neoclassical, the preferred style of local father and son architects John and Wilson Ely.\nTen murals from the original banking halls at mezzanine level depict key people in Newark history, including the founding Puritans who purchased land for a settlement on the west bank of the Passaic River from the resident Lenni Lenape in 1666. Also shown is Elisha Boudinot, a lawyer and spy for George Washington who became a state supreme court justice after the war and the founding president of Newark’s first bank.\nThat institution merged with Essex County National Bank in 1903, which accounts for the original name of this highrise, though it was simplified long ago to National Newark Building. Now occupied by law firms, the tower initially housed numerous government offices including the state liquor control board. When Prohibition was repealed in 1933, the building was so mobbed by prospective bar owners seeking a liquor license that a police guard was required and the office stayed open past midnight.",

        "description": "Turquoise, gold, and cerulean blue glazed terracotta tiles sheath this Art Deco landmark that was originally a department store — actually, two department stores under one roof. The four clock faces held special significance for Adolph Sieroty, a Polish immigrant who got his start in L.A. retail when he opened a clock shop.\nBolstered by Sieroty’s willingness to sell on credit, the business grew into Eastern Outfitting, a California chain of furniture and housewares stores. A retail clothing business, Columbia Outfitting, prospered too, and in 1930 Sieroty put both into this flagship store. Entering through the three-story vestibule under a Mayan-inspired sunburst design in gold leaf and glazed tiles, visitors could stroll past displays for Columbia men’s and women’s outfits on the left and Eastern home furnishings on the right. Up above, beneath the clock, a model bungalow showhome stood in the rooftop garden. Fashion shows filled the 700-seat auditorium on the 12th floor.\nThe retail business closed in 1957, and Sieroty’s son Julian converted the tower to office space. Now it has been renovated as a condominium with 147 residential units. Swimmers in the rooftop pool never have to wonder what time it is.",

        "description": "What was once New Jersey’s tallest office tower took its name from the neighboring six-acre lawn, a former drill ground for Continental Army troops under George Washington that later became a Civil War recruitment point. While Military Park now contains a sword-shaped flowerbed and a war sculpture by the artist who carved Mount Rushmore, the highrise it fronts picks up the martial theme with panels depicting Union soldiers, one dressed in stylish Zouave garb.\nGrotesque warrior figures along the second floor further emphasize the military spirit, as did the maintenance staff and elevator operators who wore cadet-style uniforms when this building first opened. Maurice Strunsky, the New York developer who led the project, had immigrated from present-day Belarus and seems to have wanted to emphasize his patriotism. An enormous U.S. flag was draped the full 21 stories of this building at its dedication, aptly held on Memorial Day.\nWhen Newark’s economy bottomed out in the 1970s, the Military Park Building was the site of city vacant property auctions. Renovated two decades ago, it now contains mostly law offices, with the Newark Downtown District, a beautification and urban improvement nonprofit organization, on the uppermost floor.",

        "description": "When a one-ton weight in Camden’s old city hall clock tower crashed down in 1929, narrowly missing four commissioners and three secretaries, officials congratulated themselves for having already started construction of a replacement.\nTo emphasize that Camden was the home of RCA Victor, a leader in sound recording and radio, the new clock tower housed a “synthetic tone producer” that mimicked the chime of Big Ben. Loudspeakers mounted to the tower blasted loud enough to be heard two miles away, causing floors to vibrate inside city hall.\nIt was all meant as a bold statement to put Camden on the map. A line by poet and longtime Camden resident Walt Whitman carved into the granite exterior gives a sense of the spirit of the project: “In a dream I saw a city invincible.”\nBut a year after the opening and further into the Great Depression, more than 3,000 angry taxpayers crowded into the building for hearings about wasteful government spending. Frederick von Nieda, a former councilman and future mayor, announced to cheers: “Camden bought a high hat and a diamond ring when it needed a pair of shoes and pants.” Subsequent efforts to sell the building have never come to fruition.",

        "description": "The rooftop sign advertising the main tenant of this highrise has been a city landmark for more than 40 years, or about as long as the original electric “Harrisburger Hotel” sign lit up the night skies over Pennsylvania’s capital. Politicians and lobbyists once flocked to its Caucus Room lounge to wheel and deal late into the evening.\nCommissioned by an investment group headed by building contractor Ray Shoemaker, this handsome brick tower features stone false balconies and Art Deco trim. But by 1969, it had declined to the point of hosting a national hobo jamboree. A real estate businessman named Charles Adler and a few of his associates snapped it up that year with the stated aim of converting it to office space.\nAdler was also the campaign fundraising boss for gubernatorial candidate Milton Shapp, and when Shapp won, he made Adler his deputy secretary for state procurement. The new governor soon came under fire when the state took a sizeable lease in the former hotel. Pundits called it “Milton’s Hilton,” but Shapp survived the controversy. Today the tenant mix includes attorneys, state officials, and nonprofits.",

        "description": "To celebrate the opening of their new skyscraper courthouse, the judges of Berks County reinstated the practice of wearing judicial robes while serving on the bench. The tradition had fallen by the wayside, but robes seemed an appropriate degree of formality for the fancy new courtrooms on the fifth and seventh floors.\nEven more striking was the lobby, which is beautifully preserved in contrasting ocher and black marble with hammered bronze elevator doors and an Italian Renaissance painted beam ceiling. Hanging above the guard desk is an original stained glass light globe of the Earth, while above the side entrance is a shield inscribed “Justitia et Lux,” Latin for justice and light.\nMiles Dechant, the local architect picked for the job, nevertheless was assailed for supposedly cutting corners. His rooftop soars with four great eagles, but county commissioners had to squabble with Dechant to supply additional promised rows of decorative lion heads. Critics alleged he used imitation gold leaf but charged for the real thing.\nCounty offices expanded to a Postmodern highrise next door in 1991. But court is still in session in Reading’s granite and limestone tower.",

        "description": "Seeking a steady hand at the controls in 1920 when eight utilities merged into Pennsylvania Power & Light, board members chose Edward Hall, a lawyer and well-connected corporate executive. Under Hall’s direction, the company broke ground on this tower, decorated with avant-garde carvings by Alexander Archipenko and topped since the day it opened with a tall flagpole.\nHall is also heralded as the savior of modern football, owing to his work as chairman of the fledgling NCAA rules committee from 1908 until his death in 1932. He championed the forward pass to speed up the game, and pushed to eliminate plays such as the “flying wedge” that led to serious injuries and occasional death on the gridiron.\nThis was the first skyscraper project for architect Wallace Harrison, who soon went on with partner Harvey Corbett to join the design team responsible for Rockefeller Center. Harrison became a major New York architect, overseeing the United Nations and Lincoln Center complexes and designing numerous midcentury skyscrapers for Time-Life, McGraw-Hill, and Exxon, as well as Empire State Plaza in Albany after his earlier patron, Nelson Rockefeller, became governor.",

        "description": "As native son Joe Biden and fans of “The Office” know, Scranton calls itself the Electric City. A sign five stories high on the original offices of the local board of trade has spelled out that moniker since 1916. The illuminated sign was put there by one of the building’s main tenants — unsurprisingly, an electric company — and refers to Scranton boasting one of the nation’s first electric trolley lines.\nAn earlier sign saying “Watch Scranton Grow” was the first to grace the rooftop in 1907. Scranton was doing exactly that at the time, as a prosperous shipping hub for the nearby anthracite coal mines.\nScranton merchants and businessmen had raised funds the previous decade to erect this eight-story building, which stands opposite the courthouse on the main square. With its name carved into the stone, the predecessor of the chamber of commerce occupied the top two floors and leased the rest to other businesses and private clubs.\nScranton Electric took ownership the year after it put up the Electric City sign, and the structure became known as the Electric Building. For a time it housed government offices, and it is now under renovation to be headquarters for its latest owner, a local bank.",

        "description": "Long known as the “Superman building” for its supposed resemblance to the Daily Planet, this long-vacant highrise is still the tallest building in Rhode Island. The green lantern at its tip could serve as a lighthouse for Narragansett Bay. Four stone eagles above it once glared at Boston and the mansions of Newport, but when one of their heads broke off and plummeted to the ground, the other three were decapitated for safety.\nIndustrial Trust was founded in 1886 by Samuel Colt, a former Rhode Island attorney general and nephew and namesake of the famed pistol maker. He did not live to see construction of this new headquarters, which features stone friezes of Providence’s founding on one side and the birth of the city’s industries on the other.\nThe great banking hall is well preserved, with tall black marble columns lining either side. But it has been unused since 2013, when successor Bank of America became the last tenant to depart, leaving the building vacant. The threat of demolition spurred action, and in 2022 the owners announced a government-subsidized plan to convert the building into 285 rental apartments.",

        "description": "Rather than leasing floors for income, as is typical of most office highrises, this one always has been occupied almost entirely by employees of the company it is named for. Travelers opened a new, nine-story Beaux-Arts headquarters in 1907, widened it just a few years later, and added the tower as a second expansion to accommodate the bigger sales force needed to meet demand for a popular new product: automobile insurance.\nThe son of a stone carver, Travelers founder James Batterson went from making gravestones to supplying granite and marble for major public buildings, including the Library of Congress, and Civil War monuments at Gettysburg and elsewhere. A trans-Atlantic voyage introduced Batterson to the European concept of accident insurance for travelers, and upon returning he launched the first U.S. company to offer such a policy.\nBatterson’s quarries supplied the granite for this building as well as the Connecticut State Capitol across town. Celebrated New York architect Donn Barber, who did all three Travelers projects, died at age 53 just weeks before he was supposed to speak at the 1925 Paris exposition that gave birth to the term “Art Deco.”\nPublic tours to the arched observatory atop Travelers Tower were discontinued in the 1990s, when winds blew an original spire encircled with brass globes off the cupola.",

The complex replaced an old city hall that burned down in 1906. The campanile has endured a similarly troublesome existence.\nA nighttime explosion blew a hole through the base while it was still under construction. When the saboteurs were apprehended, they confessed to a string of bombings and said they took orders from a national ironworkers union in a scheme to terrorize capitalists into employing only unionized workers on construction projects. One got life in San Quentin.\nFormer president William Howard Taft came to hear the chimes and bronze bell peal at the dedication, and the problems seemed to be over. Then 25 years later, a repair crew checking the malfunctioning chimes found flattened bullets scattered on the observation deck and realized the tower was being used for target practice. Surely some shooters used Springfield rifles, which were manufactured at the major federal arms works in town for more than a century.\nDecades have passed since the tower bells last tolled, and the clock is also out of commission. Black safety netting keeps the limestone corners from crumbling while funds are sought for an extensive and expensive restoration.",

For decades it dominated the harborfront, buzzing with the activity of customs agents collecting tariffs on imported goods unloaded from ships docked at the wharf.\nBefore the United States adopted the income tax, tariffs and customs duties were the main source of federal revenue. When the busy port of Boston outgrew its 1847 custom house, a committee decided to preserve the stately edifice while shooting a tower nearly 500 feet tall through the top of its original dome. The unorthodox design was one of the last by Boston architects Robert Peabody and John Stearns, who died in 1917 at their respective summer homes within a week of each other.\nThe property was converted into a timeshare hotel in 1997, and guests now gather in its former counting room each morning for the breakfast buffet. Its impressive multistory rotunda is ringed with the flags of prominent merchant shipping firms from long ago. Above the tower clock faces, an outdoor public observatory offers spectacular views from all four sides. Visits are free and require only an advance reservation.",

        "description": "The wedding cake shape of this and other Deco-era American highrises was due to zoning rules requiring floors above a certain height to step back, letting more sunlight down to the street. Such limits clearly could not quash this building’s exuberance, with its terracotta floral panels stretching to the roofline.\nNearer to the sidewalk, stylized bronze bas-reliefs display acts of labor and technological prowess by burly men who are mostly shirtless and occasionally pants-less. Mythical heroic figures join the cast over the main entrance on Franklin Street. A well-preserved honey and ebony marble lobby shows off additional craftsmanship and metalwork.\nThe highrise was financed by a consortium led by Louis Abrons, a New York builder whose family immigrated from present-day Belarus when he was a boy. One lead investor was stockbroker Charles Hayden, who made a fortune in copper mining, then built public planetariums in Boston and New York that still bear his name.\nOriginally called the Tower Building, this was more commonly referred to by its ground floor tenants Second National Bank and later State Street Trust. In 1985 the building became part of 75-101 Federal Street when it was fused to a taller office tower erected next door after Boston finally relaxed its height limits.",

        "description": "Strict municipal height restrictions historically kept Boston out of the skyscraper races. But with this building, the venerable city ironically served as the proving ground for one of the master architects of turn-of-the-century highrises.\nCass Gilbert had earned renown in 1895 by winning a competition to design the new capitol building in his home state of Minnesota. The following year he secured his first tall office project, this Beaux-Arts confection for brokers, bankers, and bond sellers. The job helped entice Gilbert to relocate to New York City, where he designed even more elaborate skyscrapers, culminating in the world’s tallest, the Woolworth Building.\nThe wedge-shaped edifice on the original site of Boston’s first town hall replaced an earlier office block built for John Brazer, a successful merchant. His granddaughter, Alice Brooks Norris, inherited half of the first Brazer Building and was a major shareholder in this successor structure. Like Gilbert, she also called the Upper Midwest home. Her Boston beau, Greenleaf Norris, set up a ship supply firm in Milwaukee, and they raised a family there. Alice capably took over and ran the business years later after he fell down the stairs and broke his neck.",

He made money in garment wholesaling, then put it into commercial lofts and offices. Through shrewd deals and luck, Lefcourt built a Manhattan skyscraper portfolio worth $125 million, and started boasting he would put up the world’s tallest one next. But the death in 1930 of his 17 - year - old son—two months before this highrise opened—sent Lefcourt reeling, and the stock market collapse wiped him out. He died of a heart attack two years later.\nAnother immigrant, Frank Grad, designed Lefcourt’s handsome Newark tower with its elegant details and opulent black marble and bronze entrances. Grad’s two sons joined him in the business, which steadily grew into New Jersey’s biggest architectural firm.\nThe tower, known for most of its existence as the Raymond Commerce Building, was vacant for nearly two decades before 2006, when it reopened as a luxury apartment complex. As its namesake knew, real estate can be unpredictable.",

They disappeared long ago, replaced by an electric billboard wrapped around the rooftop. Before its long-defunct Samsung sign, the tower at the entrance to L.A.’s “Miracle Mile” has also advertised beer and two insurance companies. For one TV season in 1952, before the sign went up, the building played the role of the Daily Planet newspaper in “Adventures of Superman.”\nOhio native Elihu Clement Wilson made his fortune in California’s oil business. Wilson founded a company to manufacture drilling tools, and got rich enough to buy a 124-foot motor yacht for cruises to Catalina Island. He then sold the company and commissioned his eponymous office building, erected in a rapidly developing part of town that had been forested with oil derricks only a decade earlier.\nMayor Meredith Snyder appointed Wilson to the city police commission in 1920, but soon came to regret it. Wilson turned on him the following year, publicly quitting a week before the election and accusing the mayor of covering up gambling, prostitution, and illegal alcohol sales in the City of Angels.

        "description": "Nine years after they opened their 13-story Hotel Rosslyn, brothers George and Dwight Hart added this nearly identical annex across the street. That brought the total number of guest rooms to 1,100, more than any other hospitality property on the West Coast. In case anyone wasn’t paying attention, the Harts topped their twin hotel buildings with huge electric signs emblazoned with their logo, a heart.\nThe brothers’ parents were Ohio farmers who came to Los Angeles during a speculative land boom in the 1880s. Their father managed the Natick Hotel in town, and they took over after his premature death. Later they bought an old hotel called the Rosslyn, which they would soon replace with a mammoth complex by the city’s preeminent architectural firm to handle the streams of tourists pouring into sunny southern California.\nBoth properties were linked by a marble-lined underground corridor so guests wouldn’t have to dodge traffic on Fifth Street when walking to the dining rooms or main reception desk. Converted recently into affordable housing for homeless veterans, the annex has had its lobby partially restored with its decorative metallic friezes and molding, marble reception desk, and attractive wrought iron skylight.",

It stands almost precisely between the Chinese and Egyptian theaters on Hollywood Boulevard, and was designed by the same architects who created those two fabled movie palaces.\nLos Angeles First National Bank & Trust, which occupied the main floor and basement, was perhaps a bit strait-laced for the neighborhood, going so far as to run ads when construction began nagging the public not to shorten the financial institution’s name by saying “L.A.” The floodlit tower ornamented with eagles, lions, and medieval figures was meant to convey grandeur and scale — and to tweak the city’s 150-foot height limit, since unoccupied structural parts such as its top section could push past the otherwise strict boundary.\nBank chairman Henry Robinson was a personal friend of President Woodrow Wilson, and he turned down several offers to join the Cabinet. He was frequently called to Washington to serve on various federal boards and committees. The U.S. Navy posthumously named a troop ship after him during World War II.",

The contractors who poured its concrete form also installed a terrazzo sidewalk in front that remains today.\nGaylord Wilshire, namesake of the building and the boulevard, was a land developer and an ardent socialist. The son of a rich Cincinnati banker, Wilshire purchased 35 acres of farmland west of what is now MacArthur Park and offered to give the city a strip down the middle as long as the road was named after him and permitted no train tracks or heavy trucks. Wilshire ran as a socialist for Congress three times — and for the British Parliament once while married to a Welsh woman — but was unsuccessful each time. He also founded a magazine, “The Challenge,” and a quack medical company, Ionaco, that made an electric plug-in belt Wilshire claimed could cure cancer, tuberculosis, arthritis, and a host of other ailments by magnetizing the iron in its wearer’s blood. \nThe building has been vacant for years and is tagged with graffiti. Its owner, one of Koreatown’s biggest landlords, is building an eight-story apartment complex behind it.",

        "description": "Sprung from an international architecture competition promoted by the self-proclaimed “World’s Greatest Newspaper,” this highrise is one of the most influential skyscrapers ever constructed. That importance is not primarily due to its Rouen Cathedral-inspired design, but rather to the more than 260 contest entries that poured in from architects around the globe eager for publicity and the $100,000 prize.\nConceived by editor, publisher, and publicity pro Robert McCormick, the Chicago Tribune contest marked the public debut of several novel architectural concepts. Many felt that it missed the obvious winner, a stepped vertical massing by Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen that earned second place. Though never built, his design became a template for the waves of Art Deco skyscrapers soon to come.\nAfter city planners widened Michigan Avenue and bridged the Chicago River, stretching the thoroughfare northward, Tribune Tower became the second highrise to go up outside the Loop after the Wrigley Building, its neighbor across the street. The tower served as the newspaper's headquarters for nearly a century and was converted into luxury apartments in 2018.  \nVisitors in the grand lobby are surrounded by quotes from McCormick and others about the value of a free press.

        "description": "Thirty years after Chicago curtailed its skyscrapers with a strict height limit, a 1923 zoning ordinance let towers exceed the cutoff as long as they occupied no more than a quarter of the lot. This telescoped highrise took advantage, soon welcoming sightseers to the city's highest observation platform. Under the original plans, visitors could have waved to other sightseers on a twin tower about 100 feet away, but the second on Michigan Avenue never got past the drawing board.\nOwner Alonzo Mather, from the same family as Puritan preacher Cotton Mather, built a company that manufactured and leased railcars for transporting livestock. The well-traveled tycoon also proposed building a bridge across the Niagara River from Buffalo to Canada, with turbines suspended in the surging current underneath to supply electrical power. Permitting delays dissuaded Mather, but a bridge was eventually constructed there, flanked by a Canadian park named after him.\nOnce prized by artists, ad agencies, and design studios for its abundant natural light, the tower is now a hotel, and its marble lobby staircase gleams almost as brightly as the new cupola. Weather and wind made the original structurally unsound, so it was removed in 2000 and a replacement was plunked on via helicopter.",

        "description": "The handsome blue and gold roof of this Gothic tower crowns an enormous structure that was once the world's largest commercial building. With two million square feet of floor space, the vast complex of showrooms allowed manufacturers to display their latest kitchen sets, couches, beds and dressers to prospective retailers. An immediate success, it inspired an even bigger Chicago successor, the Merchandise Mart.\nAmerican Furniture Mart was the brainchild of Lawrence Whiting, who headed it for decades. A former football and track star at the University of Chicago, Whiting came from a banking family and served as chief personnel officer of the American Expeditionary Force in World War I. \nThe tower section, a later addition to the original structure, has been converted to residential units. Rich stonework surrounding the arched entrance gives the impression of a cathedral, but for most of its existence this building's street number was 666 — the number of the beast in the Book of Revelation. That was changed in 1988, with some claiming it was done to assuage a new major tenant, Playboy Enterprises. The magazine left in 2012, and the main building now mostly houses medical offices.",

        "description": "To burnish their patriotism and prestige after World War I, Chicago businessmen of German descent built a skyscraper for their private club, named after the Prussian noble who trained George Washington's troops. To design their Teutonic tower, they chose a Chicago immigrant trained at the Munich Royal School of Architecture.\nClub rooms originally filled the narrow upper tower, while the bulkier lower part was mostly leaseable office space, topped with the club's exercise rooms and handball courts, a lavish two-story ballroom and main dining hall, and a skylit natatorium. Financial problems forced the club members to sell shortly after opening, and the ballroom's pipe organ was repossessed for the Black Forest village attraction of the city's 1933 World's Fair. The pool is still enjoyed by residents of the recently renovated highrise.\nLate one night in 1948, William Granata, an aspiring Republican politician who lived in the tower apartments, was found hacked to death in the revolving door. His murder was never solved, though it bore the markings of a mob hit. Granata's sister, Ursula, had been the secretary and former fiancee of \"Easy Eddy\" O'Hare, who ratted out Al Capone for income tax evasion in 1931 and was subsequently shotgunned in his car eight years later.",

        "description": "With its shape, its sheen, and its swathes of gleaming glass, this 19th century highrise was decades ahead of its time. It was built for a high-tech entrepreneur, William Hale, who lost an office block in the Great Fire of 1871. Hale put a water tank on his next commercial property to supply firehoses in an emergency, and the water also powered the city's first hydraulic passenger elevator. Hale went on to manufacture and sell the contraptions, providing technology that made skyscrapers feasible.\nHale then commissioned his friend Daniel Burnham to draw up the Reliance Building. The office tower was for doctors and dentists, who required ample sunlight for their exam rooms, so Burnham covered two-thirds of the street-facing facade with glass. Construction took place in two stages, because tenants in the existing four-story building on the parcel had different lease terms. When the ground floor lease expired, Burnham suspended the upper three floors on jacks and built a new department store below them. When the upstairs lease ran out, a steel-framed tower arose atop the new ground floor.\nNow a hotel, the property boasts a few historically restored floors and an attractive elevator lobby with some original elements. Guests are presumably grateful that the original Hale elevators were replaced long ago.",

        "description": "Transcontinental railroad travelers ended their westward journey not by train but by boat at this station, which handled up to 47 million passengers a year. When the 1906 earthquake struck, it stopped the 22-foot clock, but the terminal and tower survived largely intact, much to the relief of refugees forced to flee across the bay.\nNew York architect A. Page Brown snagged the job after designing a tomb for Charles Crocker, president of the Southern Pacific Railroad, which supplied most ferry traffic. Politicians worried over the bidding, and Brown's payment was frozen during construction; before the dispute was resolved, he died from injuries sustained after his horsecart went off a bridge.\nBridges — the Bay and the Golden Gate — also killed off ferry service. An elevated Embarcadero Freeway added insult to injury, barricading the building from Market Street. Demolition talk roused defenders like Herb Caen, who wrote: \"The waterfront without the Ferry Tower would be like a birthday cake without a candle.\" Ironically, another earthquake essentially saved the structure — the 1989 Loma Prieta tremor so damaged the freeway that it was razed, releasing the forlorn terminal from its isolation.\nIt has since had an extensive facelift and has been reborn as a marketplace, the handsome grand nave illuminated by its original 660-foot skylight. Even the ferries have returned.",

        "description": "When this tower debuted, its top stories housed the west coast studios of a brand new company called NBC. But its most famous tenant was fictional: Dashiell Hammett's noir gumshoe Sam Spade, whose detective agency was said to be on the fifth floor.\nThe highrise was the namesake of a short-lived Los Angeles bond house. It became 111 Sutter after its sponsors were absorbed and remains popular with investment firms. New York architects Schultze & Weaver dreamed up half a dozen luxury hotels in the same French Renaissance trappings on display here, though neither their Lexington and Sherry-Netherland hotels in Manhattan nor any of their three Biltmores boasts a copper mansard roof quite like this one, accented with a quiver of spiky spires. The richly sculpted entryway opens to a marble lobby over which loom massive painted beams.\nCrocker Bank, founded by Big Four railroad tycoon Charles Crocker, was a major tenant from the start. In 1969, the bank bought the building and announced plans to tear it down eventually in favor of a new skyscraper on the block. The skyscraper got built, but Wells Fargo swallowed up Crocker Bank before it could do any harm to this magnificent terracotta pile.",

        "description": "The city's tallest highrise for almost three decades dons the robing of a Gothic cathedral, with arched windows, painted groined vaults in the lobby, and intricate tracery above the entrance. Its medieval motif is expressed with a more modern membrane through the use of glazed terracotta rather than stone.\nThe name comes from the parcel's first owner, Christian Russ, a German silversmith in New York whose luck seemingly ran out when his jewelry shop was robbed. Ruined, Russ enlisted in the army to fight in the Mexican-American War. He and his family boarded a ship for a tiny California outpost then called Yerba Buena, intending to start anew once hostilities ended. The conflict was brief, and then came the Gold Rush. As lucky prospectors brought their loot to San Francisco, Russ opened the town's first jewelry shop and turned their nuggets into necklaces.\nGeorge Kelham was supervising architect for the 1915 World's Fair, and the Russ Building is one of three major San Francisco skyscrapers he did in the 1920s that are clustered along a two-block stretch. The stylistic progression is clear, from the Classical carved stone of the 1922 Standard Oil Building to the Russ's terracotta Gothic to the Deco-inflected Shell Building of 1929.",

        "description": "Colloquially known as “Mayor Mott’s wedding cake,” the first city hall to be built as a skyscraper seems almost good enough to eat, with white granite walls drizzled with terracotta icing. The matrimonial moniker originated in the mayor's surprise nuptials to a Berkeley schoolteacher while construction was underway.\nFrank Mott is best remembered for helping his city shelter 150,000 homeless San Francisco earthquake victims in 1906. The busy executive also wrested control of the waterfront and port from the railroad, expanded city parks and dredged the tidal basin known as Lake Merritt, inaugurated a civil service system, reorganized the police and fire departments, and established Oakland's first city museum.\nBesides elegant, high-ceilinged council chambers, the highrise houses courtrooms, various municipal departments and offices, a medical ward, and behind the slit windows lining the top floor beneath the clock tower, jail cells. Built of reinforced concrete to be earthquake proof, the skyscraper suffered severe seismic stress in 1989 and was retrofitted with a new steel skeleton and placed on a floating foundation. A memorial oak tree in front was planted in memory of the novelist and socialist activist Jack London, whom Mott defeated in the 1905 mayoral race.",

        "description": "The newspaper it advertises ceased to exist, but this campanile-style tower encircled in electric orange neon remains a treasured element of the Oakland skyline. Its former owners were politicians who both turned to publishing after their reach for higher office exceeded their grasp.\nAlameda native Joseph Knowland, son of a prosperous lumber merchant, served six terms as a Republican congressman, then bought the Oakland Tribune after losing a race for senator. He relocated the paper to a six-story furniture company showroom in 1918, added the tower five years later, and began grooming his son, William, for bigger things. The younger Knowland got as far as senate majority leader, but flopped in an ill-advised run for governor in 1958. Succeeding his father as publisher, Knowland became increasingly burdened by gambling debts. In 1974, two days after commemorating the newspaper's 100th anniversary, he shot himself.\nThe elevator goes to the 20th floor, where radio station KLX once had its studios behind the clock. Up two flights of unfinished stairs is the workshop of neon light caretaker and renegade artist John Law, one of the founders of Burning Man.",

So said Wilbur Foshay, who apparently saw no issue with emblazoning his name in lights on a purported presidential memorial. It was one of many dubious claims made by Foshay, who went to prison four years after this highrise opened.\nAn eastern transplant who briefly managed a Kansas power company, Foshay relocated to Minneapolis and built a portfolio of small utilities, paying a fraction up front and financing the rest by issuing shares for sale to the public. As his paper empire ballooned to 30 states, he commissioned the tower and financed a blowout three-day dedication gala headlined by John Philip Sousa.\nTwo months later, the market crashed, investors were stuck with worthless stock, and the company went into receivership. Foshay was convicted of mail fraud and served three years in Leavenworth, until a letter-writing campaign by his supporters prompted a commutation from Franklin D. Roosevelt.\nThe failed businessman then brought his creative energies to Colorado, where he ran a promotional campaign claiming the mountain streams were so cold that the trout grew fur. Visitors to the tower, now a swanky hotel, can have cocktails in a mahogany-paneled lounge that was once, if only briefly, Foshay's office.",

        "description": "Terracotta nurses survey the prairie from this highrise, revealing its medical mission and paying tribute to the women essential to its success. That includes Edith Graham, the clinic's first professional nurse and wife of Dr. Charles Mayo, who with his brother, Will, oversaw this tower for their family's storied institution.\nTheir father, William, arrived in town as a government physician to examine Union recruits for the Civil War. Later, when a tornado devastated Rochester in 1883, Mayo cared for victims with the aid of Franciscan nuns. The sisters went on to build a hospital that the doctor and his two sons staffed.\nThe practice quickly outgrew its first facility, prompting construction of this colorful addition. Great bronze doors open to a flamboyant lobby and oil painting of the brothers, whose offices upstairs are preserved as a museum. A carilloneur — the clinic's fourth since construction — plays daily concerts on the tower bells.\nIn 1954 the building was named after Dr. Henry Plummer, a thyroid specialist who designed several innovative features of the structure, including an instrument sterilization system. On the facade, a sculpted stone relief portrays Plummer poring over a blueprint. A similar tile commemorating the actual architect, Thomas Ellerbe, was never mounted.",

Its irrelevance only heightened when the company moved out a few years later. But St. Paul maintains the iconic sign, presumably to inform Minneapolis where the older, smaller twin city sees itself in the pecking order.\nThis skyscraper originated in an earlier merger, when First National Bank of St. Paul joined forces with nextdoor neighbor Merchants National, the first bank to build a highrise on the block. A skybridge connecting the 17th floor of the new tower to the 16th of the old curiously rises instead of descending, due to differing story heights. Louis Hill, chairman of First National, wrangled the deal through deft family diplomacy; his father, Great Northern Railroad tycoon James Hill, had bought the bank in 1912 and left his eight children each an equal share.\nNews coverage at the dedication noted a basement shooting range where the private security guards could practice \"the manly art of bank defense.\" It also marveled that every one of the uniformed women operating the elevators was exactly 5'1\" tall.",

        "description": "When Milwaukee held a nationwide design contest for their city hall in 1891, few were surprised when the winning entry was a German Renaissance-inspired design drawn up by a German-born architect. A quarter of the population of the city known as \"German Athens\" were immigrants from the Fatherland, the most of any U.S. city.\nThe enormous belfry was 353 feet tall even without counting a 40-foot flagpole, meaning that, for a moment in history, Milwaukee had a highrise taller than anything in Chicago or New York. History was made again in 1910, when Emil Seidel took office here as the first Socialist mayor of a large American city.\nThis building was designed before steel framing was universal. Its load-bearing walls support their own weight, as well as the building’s most remarkable feature: seven stories of floating wrought iron walkways that hang dramatically over the tiled atrium floor.\nIntended for the simple task of getting from the stairs to the offices on each floor, the walkways became a popular spot for committing suicide during the Great Depression, prompting the city to stretch protective netting across the void in 1935. It stayed for more than 50 years, until the walkways were restored to their full vertiginous glory.",

So a federal judge padlocked the grill, and excavators had to leave the room propped on pilings for a year while they tore down everything around it to dig the foundation.\nThe flame beacon on the roof, while not original, signals the building's main purpose as utility offices and showrooms for gas appliances. The gas was not the natural kind, but rather manufactured by cooking coal. This was done at a large plant on the city's west side designed by local architect Alexander Eschweiler, who also designed iconic gas stations in the shape of Japanese pagodas. His three sons joined his firm just in time for this skyscraper project.\nA large bronze sunburst over the entrance, destroyed in an earlier remodeling, has been replaced and complements other Mayan-inspired elements. The exterior lightens as it rises, and it is not Wisconsin's famed dairy output but the pale yellow local bricks at the top that are the source of the Milwaukee moniker \"Cream City.\"",

        "description": "Few highrises can match the bombast of Seattle’s Smith Tower, which has always claimed to be 42 stories tall, though anyone with eyes can count the windows and see it is not. But rather than quibble about an exaggerated floor count, pay a visit to the opulent original Chinese lounge on the 35th floor and enjoy stunning views from the outdoor observatory of Puget Sound and Mount Rainier, clouds permitting.\nIt was built by a maker of revolutionary office technology: typewriters. Lyman Smith and his brothers started out manufacturing shotguns in Syracuse, N.Y. When a competing upstate arms maker, Remington, produced the first mechanical typewriter, Smith's gunsmiths figured out an improved version with capital and lowercase letters. The company retooled its precision machining plant for peaceful purposes and later became part of Smith-Corona.\nSmith's wife, Flora, and son, Burns, visited Seattle in 1888 and were smitten, so he invested in several downtown parcels sight unseen. He finally made it out for the 1909 World's Fair, and while there announced plans to build an 18-story skyscraper. His son talked him into making it the West Coast's tallest building, which it remained until the Space Needle debuted at the 1962 World's Fair.",

        "description": "The original promoter of this sports skyscraper skedaddled under scrutiny for questionable real estate dealings. The financier who stepped in after him to finish the job later went to prison for financial misdeeds. Neither man was as noteworthy as the local high school girl who trained in the Washington Athletic Club's sixth-floor swimming pool.\nMembers invited Helene Madison and her coach to join them even before the doors of their new highrise opened. In a brief but unprecedented career, Madison became the only athlete in history to hold every world record in a sport — 16 record women's freestyle times from 100 meters to a mile — and capped that achievement by winning three gold medals at the 1932 Olympics.\nThe pool is now named after her, and a plaque at sidewalk level honors another important woman in the club's history: Hannah Newman, the prior owner of the parcel. Her husband diplomatically had it cast to balance out a statue he commissioned in Alaska to honor another woman, a long-lost love he met during the Klondike gold rush.\nThe club's winged logo features prominently in the sculpted terracotta facade. Preserved elements inside include etched elevator doors and the original club library.",

Engineers leveled it with water cannons and used the dirt to fill in a marshy tidal flat to allow urban sprawl, including this terminal and its adjacent railyard. Excavators also bored a mile-long train tunnel under the downtown to this station to cut down on congestion.\nJames Hill, a Minnesota shipping clerk with only one functioning eye thanks to a childhood incident with an arrow, convinced investors to join him in building the first privately financed transcontinental tracks, the Great Northern Railway. Hill became one of the wealthiest Gilded Age rail barons and gained control of the Northern Pacific, one of the three original — and deeply state-subsidized — West Coast routes and his main competition for Seattle-bound traffic. \nBoth lines stopped at this station, crowned by a clock tower modeled on Venice's famed campanile. The building was designed by Hill's preferred Minnesota architects, who later produced plans for Michigan Central Station in Detroit and assisted with New York's Grand Central. Their lavishly appointed main waiting room was the victim of a midcentury mauling but has been exquisitely restored.",

Its roof is capped by tapered spires meant to resemble evergreens, while its dark gray marble lobby, brightened by a gold leaf ceiling, feels like an elegant cave. Spelunk to the end to find a bronze map of the Pacific and a plaque with the founders of the insurance company that erected the building.\nOhio brothers Tasso and David Morgan came to Oregon in 1887 and started an insurance business, relocating to Seattle in 1906. They bundled health and accident policies with life insurance, a novel combination that won them many customers. Innovations persisted, including a \"souvenir tower policy\" commemorating this skyscraper's dedication that offered a triple payout if the holder died in a car crash.\nNow known as Seattle Tower, the building stands on the original site of the University of Washington, which relocated in 1895 but continues to lucratively lease its large lot, called the Metropolitan Tract. Architect Abraham Albertson came to Seattle in 1907 to supervise construction of a Beaux-Arts office and retail complex on the sprawling tract, including the Cobb Building, the earlier development's sole survivor, just across what is still called University Street.",

        "description": "This highrise is one of countless hotels named for America's youngest president. Theodore Roosevelt visited Seattle in 1903 in a ceremonial flotilla, his bully pulpit bluster set at full wattage. The chief executive assured the welcoming crowd that their neighbor Alaska would eventually surpass the Scandinavian peninsula in population — a feat that would have required 7 million more Alaskans then, or 15 million now.\nSeattle semi-Scandinavian Severt Thurston, an Icelandic immigrant, headed Western Hotels, the regional chain that opened the Roosevelt in 1930. Steady growth over the following decades led to a name change, first to Western International, then the abbreviated Westin. Thurston's successor, Edward Carlson, also organized the 1962 Seattle World's Fair and inspired its centerpiece, the Space Needle.\nThat futuristic tower was the creation of architect John Graham, whose father designed this hotel. The senior Graham was prolific; the hotel was one of two Art Deco towers he contributed to Seattle's skyline in 1930, along with the Exchange Building.\nNow the boutique Hotel Theodore, the property features avant-garde lobby art and displays curated from the Museum of History and Industry. The bold decor mirrors the spirit of the original hotel, which when it opened had a coffee shop painted with scenes of life on other planets.",

        "description": "While the legendary English navigator is believed to have landed in California during his 16th century circumnavigation of the globe, his Golden Hind never sailed through the Golden Gate. Still, Drake's name was affixed to one of San Francisco's swankiest hotels for nearly a century, until a long Covid shutdown resulted in new owners and a new name.\nThe Drake's Beefeater doorman was once the city's most photographed resident. Other men in fancy costumes performed a long-running Sunday drag brunch in the top-floor Starlight Room. But the most astonishing transformation belonged to the hotel itself. One night in 1954 while high on peyote, Allen Ginsberg saw the facade melt into \"the robot skullface of Moloch.\" The vision inspired his Beat poem \"Howl,\" which Ginsberg penned in the Drake's coffee shop.\nThe highrise was built for Fort Worth hotelier Leon Huckins, who sold it in 1938 to another Texan, Conrad Hilton, then just beginning to expand his hospitality chain outside the Lone Star State. Charles Weeks, the architect, died months before the Drake opened. Engineer William Day had years left; he built Treasure Island in the bay for San Francisco's 1939 World's Fair. One of its most heralded exhibits was a brass plate allegedly left by Drake himself on California's shores, though it was later proven to be a forgery.",

Each contestant was controlled by one of the world's richest families: Rothschilds vs. Rockefellers.\nOnly three years after opening an office in the United States, the British-Dutch conglomerate built a refinery in 1915 at Martinez, on the tidal estuary emptying into San Francisco Bay. Shell's geologists fanned out across the state seeking petroleum to fill their tankers, each ship christened with the names of various shells — Murex, Cowrie, Conch, Clam — to honor the founder's father, a London seashell merchant. In 1921 Shell hit a massive gusher at Signal Hill near Long Beach, and soon California was producing a quarter of the world's oil.\nWhen Standard moved into a new skyscraper the following year, Shell temporarily leased their rivals' former offices just across Bush Street. Next the European upstarts hired George Kelham — the same architect responsible for the Standard Oil Building — to design them a taller headquarters a block away. Eventually, with their West Coast wells sucked dry, Shell and Standard successor Chevron packed up and moved to Texas. Now new tenants occupy George Kelham's battling Bush Street highrises.",

Its architects revised their blueprints in the aftermath to add new safety features — reinforced concrete, water standpipes, and automatic doors to seal the elevator shafts from fire — while the bank commissioned six more stories in the slab behind the tower to take advantage of inflated demand for office space.\nGeorge Luchsinger, Humboldt's president during the project, was the son of one of the founders, a Swiss-born furniture maker who built a fortune manufacturing wooden rocker boxes prospectors used to sift gold from gravel. Sadly, leading his father's institution did not allay the executive's severe depression, and Luchsinger committed suicide in 1914 with his basement gas stove. Depositors panicked until the state bank examiner reassured them that their savings were secure, and Humboldt's attorney stepped in at the helm.\nThe attractive dome complemented a more famous one that used to top the Spreckels Building at the other end of the block. The rich terracotta molding of the Humboldt entryway is well preserved, as is its former banking hall, now a clothing store.",

        "description": "Bold Mayan decorative motifs and a strikingly unique silhouette make this building a singular specimen of Art Deco's outer limits. Timothy Pflueger designed it for a dentist, Dr. Francis Morgan, who dabbled in real estate and wanted another medical and dental complex like one he had opened in Los Angeles. The T-shaped tower he got has a lobby so dazzlingly ornamented in burgundy marble, cast aluminum elevators, and gilded reverse-ziggurat ceiling and light fixtures that patients exiting might wonder if their anesthesia has truly worn off.\nAfter this project, Pflueger's affinity for the avant garde led him to lure muralist Diego Rivera to San Francisco for several commissions, including a series of giant concrete panels for the World's Fair on Treasure Island in 1940. Rivera rewarded his patron by portraying the architect and two of his skyscrapers — this one and Pacific Telephone & Telegraph — on the panels. Pflueger's theatricality also made him a natural at designing movie palaces and luxe hotel lounges.\nOne noteworthy physician who practiced at 450 Sutter was Dr. Harry Benjamin, a pioneering sexologist. Benjamin was among the first to offer hormonal treatment and surgical referrals to patients wishing to change gender, and he wrote a groundbreaking 1966 medical textbook, \"The Transsexual Phenomenon.\"",

The boast has mostly held up, with exceptions for a couple tall neighbors and the modern towers downtown blocking a few vantages towards Oakland.\nOpening his architectural practice a year before the 1906 earthquake, Herman Baumann found plenty of work. He specialized in apartments; this one, like his Gaylord Hotel in Nob Hill, places Spanish flourishes onto a stark white Deco form. The Bellaire was built for Guy Hardison, a Santa Paula citrus rancher whose father had come west from the Pennsylvania oilfields to try drilling along the Santa Clara River and struck it rich, co-founding Union Oil.\nAnother oil baron's son, Peter Getty, once lived in the penthouse. He sold it to his friend and business partner, then-mayor Gavin Newsom, who enjoyed the views only for a few years before moving out to begin an eventually successful quest for the governorship. Other residents who climb to the windswept roof deck for its panoramas can see the Pacific and the farthest reaches of San Francisco Bay, with the aforementioned exceptions.",

A lobby display of bronze doorknobs emblazoned with \"CS” are the only clue to its former identity as the Claus Spreckels Building.\nThe German immigrant ran a grocery store and a brewery before opening a sugar refinery. With relentless focus, Spreckels built an empire of cane plantations in Hawaii, beet fields in California, factories, ships, and railroads to supply West Coast tables with sugar.\nWhen the San Francisco Chronicle alleged stock fraud, Spreckels's outraged son Adolph burst into its newsroom and shot the editor, Michael de Young. The victim survived, the assailant got away with a temporary insanity plea, and the rivalry intensified. Spreckels bought the San Francisco Call and built it a new headquarters overshadowing the Chronicle building across the street.\nThe Call's tower rode out the 1906 earthquake intact but gutted by fire. It was restored and the presses rolled again, but Spreckels's oldest son, John, preferred San Diego and eventually sold the paper to Michael de Young. Adolph and his wife, Alma, avenged the family honor by building an art museum to dwarf de Young's, but he parried with an expansion; today cooler heads have combined the two institutions.",

        "description": "It seemed like a good idea at the time, combining four city Methodist Episcopal congregations into one new church with an attached hotel whose patrons would pay off its construction debt. Rev. Walter Sherman persuaded his flock, at any rate. They named the hostelry after a missionary who established their faith's first congregation in San Francisco.\nWorshipers filled the 1,500-seat sanctuary for its first service on Easter Sunday in 1930 to hear Sherman's sermon. But financial problems swiftly arose, leading to foreclosure. Other hoteliers entered the picture, relaunching as the Empire Hotel and converting the upper floor to a cocktail lounge. Their efforts also foundered, so they sold it to the federal government to billet draftees during World War II. The church's gothic vaults were later concealed with a drop ceiling and the space became an IRS office.\nThe worship space is now unused, but the building has been a dormitory for students at the nearby law school since 1981. Originally named after its founder, Serranus Hastings, the first chief justice of the California Supreme Court, the institution recently changed its name after historians uncovered how Hastings backed a bloody campaign by Mendocino County settlers against the resident Yuki people.",

        "description": "The craggy granite peaks of the Sierra Nevadas were the inspiration for the young architect who designed this as his first skyscraper, though its gray walls are terracotta, not stone. Despite a lack of formal training, Timothy Pflueger rose rapidly from apprentice draftsman to junior partner at his mentor's firm before the pair won this commission. It was briefly the city's tallest highrise until the Russ Building surpassed it by mere inches. \nA newspaper poet dubbed the new phone company headquarters \"a shimmery, gleaming monument to Talk!\" For George McFarlane, president of Pacific Telephone & Telegraph, the California subsidiary of AT&T, fawning poetry was far preferable to the ugly headlines his company had endured in its rocky recent history. Besides labor unrest and recurring strikes by its linemen and operators, Pacific was the main culprit in a 1906 city hall bribery scandal that got the mayor's right-hand man sentenced to 14 years in San Quentin.\nNow the headquarters of numerous high-tech companies, the building stood vacant for several years after the phone company left. Luckily, Pflueger's spectacular lobby has survived in nearly pristine condition, with its black mottled marble walls, lacquered multicolor trim, and orange ceiling embossed with Chinese animal prints.",

Robinson played an active civic role, heading a committee that established a public health clinic in 1921 in memory of Ethel Moore, a leading social worker and activist. He then became president of the Oakland Chamber of Commerce, which would later lease the third floor of Harrison's highrise.\nPerhaps most consequentially, he personally lobbied Herbert Hoover to provide federal funds to build the Bay Bridge. Harrison headed the bridge's finance committee during its construction and served as the master of ceremonies in 1936 for its dedication, when the governor, instead of cutting a ribbon, severed a golden chain with an acetylene torch.\nTerracotta trim at the base features eagles, shields emblazoned with \"FCB,\" and a pair of rams glowering over the entryway. The modern massing and lines of the exterior transition to wrought-iron railings and a bronze decorative motif of Romans in profile in the two-story marble lobby. Architects Walter Reed and William Corlett would more fully commit to Art Deco in their next project, a ziggurat-like Palo Alto hospital known as Hoover Pavilion.",

        "description": "Depending on the wind, the duck on this highrise's weathervane might either be taking off or preparing to land at nearby Lake Merritt. The former tidal marsh that became a city centerpiece was created by and named after Dr. James Merritt, former mayor and a founder of the bank, which is Alameda County's oldest.\nA Massachusetts surgeon, Merritt came to San Francisco to get rich and did so almost despite himself. His first scheme was to send a ship to get ice from the Pacific Northwest. When the crew discovered ponds didn't freeze thick there as they do in New England, they returned with a load of lumber, which found a ready market. The physician's second planned venture was to import coal from Australia, but his shipmaster instead brought oranges from Tahiti, correctly guessing they would be far more profitable.\nMerritt bought extensive property in Oakland, and as its mayor pushed a plan to dam the estuary, turning it from a public sewer to a scenic haven for migratory waterfowl. He persuaded the state to ban hunting around it, creating the first government-owned wildlife refuge in the United States.\nThe tower was an addition to the adjoining eight-story bank. Its interior has intricate restored plaster coffered ceilings and lovely decorative pilasters in the lobby stairwell.",

        "description": "Money was no object for the Fisher brothers, the auto tycoons who ordered this opulent edifice enveloped inside and out with marble. It is Albert Kahn's most spectacular creation, if not his most consequential — his no-nonsense car factories inspired the next movement in architecture, the International style.\nKahn, who came to Detroit as a boy with his German family, showed early promise with his house designs before landing a 1902 commission for a Packard plant. The reinforced concrete structure, well lit by floor-to-ceiling windows, led to a Model T factory job from Henry Ford, and Kahn quickly became known as a master of industrial design.\nThe Fisher brothers manufactured wooden car bodies for some of the first automobiles, and got their big break in 1910 when Cadillac ordered 150. In 1926 their factories — including one by Kahn — rolled out a million, and General Motors bought the business. When oldest brother Fred Fisher broke ground on this highrise the next year, it was meant to be the first of three towers on the block, but the Great Depression intervened.\nTour groups still goggle in awe at the frescoes, chandeliers, marble, and mosaics in the breathtaking three-story arcade. Traveling Broadway shows perform at the theater, which was originally decorated as a Mayan temple.",

        "description": "Vivid tile patterns play across the orange brick of this highrise, a technicolor tower hailed at its dedication as a \"vertical rainbow\" for the bold use of color inside and out. The inspiration came to architect Wirt Rowland on a trip to Barcelona, where he admired the Sagrada Familia and other polychromatically iconoclastic edifices by Antoni Gaudí.\nRowland lived a block from Detroit's Pewabic Pottery, and asked its founder, Mary Chase Stratton, to decorate this building's concave half-dome entryway. Her design of an aviator appears to spring from a Navajo blanket, flanked by figures resembling 8-bit space Aztecs. The dazzling elevator lobby and banking hall they guard are a scarcely controlled riot for the optic nerve, a throne room for the Queen of Legos.\nThat Rowland persuaded a trust company to let him try out his ideas on their new building testifies to his lofty reputation among the city's corporate elite. The skyscraper opened as the Union Trust Building, but its name changed within a year after merger with the Guardian Group, and the institution went into receivership soon after. The army put a production command center here during World War II, and today the Guardian is America's most fantastic county office building.",

It was built for James Book and his brothers, Frank and Herbert, who came into a sizable inheritance from their family's vast holdings of Michigan land.\nThe boys grew up in the Cadillac Hotel on Washington Boulevard, and when their father died in 1916, they decided to turn the three-block thoroughfare into Detroit's version of Fifth Avenue. They asked architect Louis Kamper, who had designed James a mansion modeled on Marie Antoinette's in Versailles, to give skyscrapers a try.\nWhen the first Book Building opened the following year, the 13-story office block included plans for this 38-story attachment in matching Italian Renaissance style. First, the brothers bought their old hotel and replaced it with the lavish Book-Cadillac. When their Book Tower opened, they unveiled an even bolder project: an 81-story behemoth on the other end of the block that would be the world's tallest skyscraper. The Great Depression put an end to those plans.\nDetroit billionaire Dan Gilbert bought Book Tower, which stood vacant following years of neglect. Both it and the original Book Building have been restored and converted into a hotel.",

But it is a handsome specimen of Art Deco nonetheless.\nThe building's namesake was 13 when he sailed from England to work on his uncle's farm near Detroit. After Stott had his own farm, he built a small milling operation. Over the years, that expanded into a sprawling complex four miles outside the city center that was the state's largest flour mill. Stott left his seven children a fortune, and they built this skyscraper in tribute to him, though that quickly soured into an inheritance squabble and lawsuit.\nArchitect John Donaldson also immigrated to Detroit as a child, albeit under less trying circumstances than Stott. His Scottish parents could afford to send their son to study in Munich and Paris. His career had a rocky start — his first business partner killed himself — but Donaldson married the young man's widow and enjoyed a long and successful career designing numerous houses and churches as well as the first two versions of the Penobscot Building.",

        "description": "Handsomely preserved although empty and unused, this pink granite and sandstone civic palace is the sole survivor of an architectural pair that once bookended Cadillac Square. Like the old city hall, which was demolished in 1961, the courthouse is topped with a tower ringed by four allegorical sculptural maidens, a copper quartet representing law, agriculture, commerce, and technology.\nCrowning the entrance below are two horse-drawn chariots and a frieze depicting county namesake General Anthony Wayne. The Revolutionary War leader was sent by President George Washington to fight the new nation's next war, a campaign against a Native American confederation that opposed U.S. expansion into the Northwest Territory.\nClassical columns and intricate mosaics adorn the interior. At the courthouse dedication, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Henry Brown, who practiced law in Detroit for 30 years, praised local architect John Scott for finding \"the happy medium between parsimony and extravagance.\" Brown also penned the infamous Plessy v. Ferguson decision, which declared racial segregation to be constitutional under the doctrine of separate but equal.\nThe judges got new courtrooms elsewhere long ago, and the last county employees departed in 2009 for the Guardian Building. Privately owned for four decades, the mothballed jewel box awaits a new purpose.",

As they prospered, both took a turn as Detroit mayor, and Christian built the first Buhl Building, which his grandsons eventually tore down and replaced with this highrise.\nWirt Rowland, who designed the General Motors building while working for Albert Kahn, jumped ship to another architectural firm that promised him more money and creative leeway for this project. It employs an unusual cross-shaped footprint, thereby doubling the number of corner offices on every floor. Terracotta tiles of varying size and rough surface augment its resemblance to a stone cathedral.\nRowland also hired Corrado Parducci to provide the ornamentation, and the Italian immigrant sculptor's Native American figures above the entrance emphasize that the structure is a New World creation that is reinventing classic architectural tropes. The duo would collaborate on skyscrapers twice more before the decade was out, and their Buhl, Penobscot, and Guardian buildings along Griswold Street reveal the dramatic evolution of their artistic vision.",

While its ornamentation is old-fashioned in keeping with Kamper's other Book commissions, the tapered setback top is a step towards a more modern silhouette.\nIndustrial Bank specialized in smaller loans for factory employees and other workers whom established banks overlooked. It was founded in 1917 by Eugene Lewis, who was a salesman for an Ohio manufacturer of roller bearings, the friction-reducing assemblies that allow axles to spin. That job put him face to face with the first car makers, and he went on to become an executive at a Detroit axle plant.\nHis bank for the masses was a success, making more than 400,000 loans in its first decade, and soon required several floors in this new skyscraper to accommodate the growing demand. Lewis headed it for more than three decades before retiring, after which it was acquired in a merger. Eventually the highrise was converted into housing for senior citizens and renamed in honor of its designer.",

        "description": "This highrise is the last and tallest of three interconnected Penobscot Buildings that demonstrate the rapid advance of early skyscraper technology, as well as a ballooning family fortune. All are named for the Maine river where Simon Murphy first learned the lumber trade before moving to Detroit in 1866 to harvest the vast Michigan pine forests.\nMurphy's timberlands would stretch to Wisconsin and eventually the West Coast, his assets multiplying with iron ore mineral rights under the trees and and oil beneath a southern California ranch. His son, William, became the lead investor and financial manager of Henry Ford's first and second car companies in 1899 and 1901, and when that contentious partnership dissolved, the younger Murphy founded Cadillac. Both men wound up rich enough for hard feelings to dissipate, and the first tenant to move into the new Penobscot was Ford's consumer finance division.\nThe building's main banking hall initially housed the Guardian Group, a local bank and trust company that merged in 1929 with a competitor opening its own Wirt Rowland-designed Art Deco skyscraper a block away. The illuminated orb at the Penobscot's pinnacle — the knob on the 'Nob — was the highest point in Detroit for nearly 50 years.",

        "description": "This is the tallest of three highrises erected in a row along Cadillac Square for John Barlum, who got his start selling meat in his father's market stalls in the square. The building's name was changed long ago, leaving its original owner as forgotten as an old wooden coal freighter bearing his name that rests at the bottom of Lake Erie.\nThe ambitious Barlum went from selling ham and bacon for his dad to managing, and eventually acquiring, a line of steamships transporting iron ore and coal to steel mills around the Great Lakes. He had two boats christened in his name, including one that sprang a leak near Sandusky and sank in 1922. Barlum then went into real estate development, opening first an office block for lawyers, then a 23-story hotel next door, and finally this imposing tower.\nIt shoots straight up from the sidewalk to the roofline 40 stories above, where spotlights picked out the gold terracotta highlights in the early years. After Barlum died, new owners in 1949 redubbed this Cadillac Tower. It recently joined the growing portfolio of Detroit antique skyscrapers owned by Rocket Mortgage founder Dan Gilbert.",

        "description": "As this headquarters for Gulf Oil was rising up to dominate the city skyline, the stature of the local banking magnate behind it was plunging just as dramatically. Andrew Mellon, who formed Gulf from his investments in the Spindletop oilfield in Texas, served three Republican presidents as Secretary of the Treasury. But the Great Depression cost him his cabinet post and reputation, turning him into a pariah.\nForced to resign amid accusations of enriching his personal portfolio while steering the economy into meltdown, the cashiered financier faced embarrassing public investigations and trial for tax fraud in the final years of his life. Still the old tycoon donated his priceless collection of paintings to the country and paid to build the National Gallery of Art to hold them.\nThe stepped pyramid capping this highrise is a blockier version of a roof design the architects used for a Wall Street bank tower. The weather beacon on top originally shone with an orange or blue light to indicate fair or foul weather ahead. That signal was later supplanted by neon lights on the roof and is now achieved with multicolor LED displays, although the value is surely more aesthetic than meteorological.",

        "description": "Opulently decorated in the style of Louis XIV, the Sun King, this highrise hostelry was paid for by the King of Beers. It is named after Adolphus Busch, who made Budweiser into America’s first mass market pilsner.\nBusch came from vineyard country in Germany's Rhine River valley and preferred wine to beer. Nevertheless, he ran a hops and barley supply business in St. Louis, where he went into partnership with brewery owner Eberhard Anheuser. Using pasteurization and refrigerated railroad cars, they shipped their bottles to distant distribution hubs including Dallas, where Busch acquired a luxurious hotel and soon planned an even better one.\nDallas officials were so eager for the project, they sold their city hall to the brewing magnate and moved out so he could have its choice downtown parcel. Overseeing the construction was a company vice president from St. Louis, Edward Faust, who also happened to be the boss's son-in-law. Faust was only following the old man's strategy — Busch had married Anheuser's daughter Lilly, and his brother Ulrich had married her sister. \nThe architects also came from St. Louis, and so did the King of Beers chandelier. It illuminated the Anheuser-Busch display at the 1904 St. Louis World’s Fair and now hangs in the main lobby.",

        "description": "On Thanksgiving night in 1931, red and amber floodlights bathed this highrise as Dallas celebrated adding five new skyscrapers to its skyline in an otherwise gloomy year. Colors swirled too in the stained glass entrance window, portraying a modern Prometheus gripping a web of cables to transmit current to the city below.\nThe power company was generated by John Strickland, a farmer and cotton gin owner in nearby Waxahachie who tried a grocery and wholesale business before managing the town's electric company. Teaming with investors, Strickland strung five small power companies together to power an interurban trolley line stretching from Dallas south to Waco and north to the Oklahoma border. He consolidated more utilities to create Texas Power & Light and Dallas Power & Light. When Strickland died in 1924, friends said his sole unrealized dream was to build a skyscraper for his companies.\nDallas stained glass artisans Joanna and Robert McIntosh created the original window for the main showroom, now a brewhouse; the office tower has been converted into apartments. Architects Otto Lang and Frank Witchell designed many Dallas highrises, including the first hotel ever built for Conrad Hilton. They honored another prolific duo, electrical inventors Thomas Edison and Charles Steinmetz, with carved busts flanking the limestone facade.",

        "description": "It did not take long for the McNeny brothers to reap the rewards for commissioning this highrise for petroleum companies. Its construction was still underway when geologists discovered the East Texas Oilfield, the biggest petroleum reservoir in state history.\nThirty years earlier, Fletcher and Frank McNeny had left their family farm in Fannin County to seek their fortune in Dallas. Fletcher first found work with the railroad and Frank in publishing; then they went into business together as McNeny & McNeny, commercial real estate agents. The brothers soon expanded their portfolio to include residential properties, acquiring 100 acres north of the city and developing the suburb of Greenland Hills.\nArchitect Mark Lemmon also designed Fair Park Stadium, known since the 1936 Texas Centennial by its adopted moniker, the Cotton Bowl. He and the McNeny brothers had offices in this building, which offered its oil industry tenants shared conference rooms, a library, and lounge.\nNow a hotel, the property is owned by music producer John Kirtland, drummer in the Texas band that recorded the 1993 hit \"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\" Guests who remember the film might kind of like that it plays on a loop in an old ticket booth display by the entrance.",

Conceived by the same architect who produced the lavish Roxy Theater in New York, this far more subdued tower got a frisky spire and clock in a 1958 remodeling.\nRobert Thornton ran an unsuccessful bookstore and mortgage lending shop before he and two partners launched a bank in 1916 that became Mercantile National. Thornton spent three decades as its president and two more as chairman, then was elected to four two-year terms as Dallas mayor. \nHe had first come to the city as an eight-year-old boy to attend the state fair; years later Thornton led lobbyists who secured the 1936 Texas Centennial Exposition for Dallas over bids from Houston and San Antonio. The fairgrounds were remade as a showcase of progress, and Thornton subsequently insisted his bank headquarters also emphasize ultramodern architecture and interior design.\nA successor bank called MCorp failed in 1989, and the property stood vacant until it was renovated into luxury apartments, including a top floor penthouse that was once a sky lounge for executives.",

        "description": "Railroads were essential to the place called Cowtown, where cattle drivers once rode the Chisholm Trail to get their herds to trains in distant Kansas. So when this highrise opened, grateful officials named the busy road it stands on after John Lancaster, president of the Texas & Pacific.\nThe railroad’s name reveals the ambition of its founders, but the Texas & Pacific never managed to lay tracks to San Diego as planned. It ran out of money and stalled in Fort Worth for several years, until robber baron Jay Gould bought the line and extended it to the state's western tip to meet the Southern Pacific.\nLancaster succeeded Gould's son as president in 1916 after a bankruptcy reorganization. At the banquet for the opening of this passenger terminal and office complex, a spiraling economy and slumping ridership led the executive to speak bluntly. \"If we do not fill up that office building,\" he said, \"at least it can be seen from a long ways off.\"\nOf the many fine Art Deco works by Wyatt Hedrick in Fort Worth, this stands out for its bold massing and rich decor. The tower offices have been converted to condominiums, and the three-story passenger waiting room is now a stunning event venue.",

        "description": "The pink granite used for this courthouse came from the same quarry that supplied stones for the state capitol. Yet this handsome structure on the bluff where soldiers first built an outpost in 1849 has never quite received the respect it warrants.\nThe Austin project received free granite in exchange for a rail spur to the quarry, but Tarrant County got no such deal, and voters in 1894 booted the county commissioners for their extravagance. When the railroad opened a highrise passenger terminal in Fort Worth in 1931, its president mocked the courthouse and implored citizens to replace it with something more modern. Demolition was entertained but never implemented, and though new buildings now host most trials, the old hall of justice survives with a few restored courtrooms, a law library, and a vertiginous four-story rotunda. \nTarrant County takes its name from Edward Tarrant, a militia commander in the Republic of Texas who ordered raids against Native American settlements in the area in 1841. Afterward, the native Caddo, Cherokee, and other tribes withdrew, negotiating a treaty with Tarrant two years later that established a new frontier at the river confluence this courthouse overlooks.",

So when this headquarters for the Amicable Life Insurance Company — later shortened to Alico — opened in 1911, citizens of Waco proudly touted the distinction.\nPlenty were stung a few years later, when visiting poet Amy Lowell compared their lofty offices to \"a toothpick in a pancake.\" But the structure proved its mettle in 1953, when a tornado that killed 114 people and destroyed nearly 200 downtown buildings failed to topple the toothpick.\nArtemas Roberts worked at several insurance companies before rounding up investors to create Amicable Life in 1909 with him as president. Roberts then turned to Fort Worth architects Sanguinet & Staats, whose 16-story Carter Building then under construction in Houston was about to surpass a 15-story office tower in Dallas.\nWith its flagpole 303 feet above the sidewalk, the 22-story Amicable Building seized the mantle for Waco. For a year, anyway, until the spire of the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas went nine feet higher, further igniting a contest for Lone Star supremacy which continues to this day.",

        "description": "Guides on the San Antonio River tour boats puttering past this highrise occasionally say its owner jumped off the roof to end it all. While not accurate in the particulars — Jim Smith shot himself in his Dallas apartment — it does reflect the shocking demise of a skyscraper speculator ruined by the Great Depression.\nSmith and his older brother, Albert, were enterprising farm boys who ran a stable and then sold cars before starting up a successful paving business. Rolling the proceeds into real estate development with their lawyer, Jim Young, they erected this eponymous Gothic office tower with its cathedral vaulted marble lobby. Designed by a local father-and-son architect duo, it was the tallest building in town for decades, offering unobstructed sight lines to its plentiful gargoyles.\nAfter the namesakes lost their building in the crash, it was redubbed Transit Tower for a bus company that moved in. The Army also leased space; Gen. Dwight Eisenhower had an office here before shipping out for World War II and the White House. In 1961 an insurance company rebranded both itself and the building as Tower Life, and that name has stuck since.",

        "description": "Naming the bank they founded in 1890 after the most hallowed building in Texas was not simply astute marketing for Charles Hugo and Sol Halff. It also illustrated how deeply the two German immigrants had assimilated in the Lone Star State.\nHugo, the bank's first president, owned a large store that incorporated part of the Alamo's original stone walls and abutted the iconic mission church. Preservationists desiring more dignity for the site persuaded the state legislature to buy the store from Hugo in 1905.\nHalff, the vice-president, had come to Texas to work at his older brother's dry goods store near Houston. They accepted payment in cattle, and as the herds burgeoned, the Halff brothers relocated to San Antonio, where Sol minded the store business while Mayer became a major rancher.\nHugo and Halff did not live to see this edifice erected two blocks from their original bank, but they surely would have approved of its huge stained glass entry window portraying the Alamo. Its colored light falls on a two-story banking hall ringed with fluted pilasters and gilded trim, now a majestic hotel lobby. Old photos, vaults, and vintage equipment add to the sense of history, while a new rooftop sign replaces one that used to tout the bank.",

        "description": "Doctors and their patients occupied this riverside highrise for most of its existence. Developer Joe Nix mostly focused on hotels, but he also built a cathedral-like medical arts building across the street from the Alamo in 1926, and followed it with this more Deco-inflected but still Gothic block four years later.\nA cast of whimsical terracotta characters line the street-level facade, making faces at passersby. Inside, the developer's entwined JMN monogram adorns the decorative bronze elevator doors — middle initials were crucial in a business that employed the owner's son and half-brother, both also named Joe Nix. The building had eight floors for parking and 10 for doctors' offices, crowned by a 200-bed hospital.\nIt was built on land once owned by Dr. Ferdinand Herff, a surgeon and professed expert at arrow removal who helped to found the city's first hospital. Operating rooms on the top floor received abundant sunlight through the windows. But staff had to shoo away vultures that sometimes perched near the windows, an unsettling sight before or after surgery. Closed since 2019, the building is being remodeled for residential use.",

        "description": "A forest of new skyscrapers has transformed the Texas capital in the last decade. But Austin's original highrise still holds a special place in the hearts of University of Texas alumni, especially when its orange lights shine to celebrate a Longhorns triumph.\nAfter vast reserves of oil were discovered on university-owned land, the board of regents went on a campus building spree and commissioned Paul Cret, an acclaimed Philadelphia architect, to put together a master plan. In 1933, the school's 50th anniversary, they announced they would tear down the original university building and replace it with a new Main Building and Tower.\nThe tower was for books, not people; it held the undergraduate library. Students looked up what they needed in the card catalog, and their requests were relayed to the closed stacks upstairs, where librarians — some wearing roller skates for maximum efficiency — collected the needed volumes and sent them down via dumbwaiter.\nThat convoluted system was replaced with a new library in 1964, and the tower was turned into offices. Two years later, a disturbed student and former marine used the observation deck as a sniper's perch, massacring 14 people and wounding another 31 before police killed him.",

        "description": "Mayan motifs adorning this highrise came about after Alfred Bossom took a vacation to Mexico. The pre-Columbian stepped stone temples profoundly impressed the eminent English architect, who later wrote that they were the first American skyscrapers.\nThis building was for Joseph Cullinan, a serial entrepreneur from the Pennsylvania oilfields whose first company made storage tanks. The first oil strikes in Texas lured him to Corsicana in 1897, which he supplied with a massive tank, and then a refinery, before stepping away in 1902 for a new venture. Called simply the Texas Company, its target was the black gold flowing out of Spindletop.\nCullinan relocated the business — later known as Texaco — to Houston a few years later, into one of the city's first skyscrapers. Pushed out by investors in 1913, he formed a new company, American Republics, and commissioned this office tower for it. Known for his temper, Cullinan also showed public spirit, funding a Houston hospital for Black patients in a time of strict segregation and chairing the committee that oversaw the creation of Mount Rushmore.\nRenamed Great Southwest after an insurance company that moved here in 1968, the building is now a hotel. Its top floor, formerly the private Tejas Club, is now a banquet and meeting hall.",

Joseph Finger, an Austrian immigrant, won the argument by insisting that the modern architecture of his adopted land was \"far above that of other countries.\"\nMayor Richard Fonville preferred to give the job to Albert Finn, who had been selected for the project years earlier before it stalled in the poor economy. In the meantime, Finn had designed the San Jacinto Monument, a towering masonry column for the 1936 centennial commemorating Texas independence. But the mayor failed to persuade the city council.\nSimple and boxy in its contours, Houston's fourth city hall depends greatly for its visual interest on a series of friezes carved into the limestone by Texas sculptor Herring Coe, whose work also textures the Art Deco courthouse in Beaumont. Ethereal pastel figures in the lobby ceiling mural represent industry, culture, law, and government.\nFlanked by sculpted bobcats, minimalist clocks at the top, one on each side, tick the minutes and hours. Mayor Fonville and other anti-modernists might prefer the old city hall clock, which is preserved in a park across town.",

        "description": "This is the most impressive of dozens of highrises that once comprised the real estate empire of Jesse Jones. The developer, banker, and publisher was not only the most powerful businessman in Houston, but also one of the most influential people in Washington, D.C.\nJones managed a Dallas lumberyard for his uncle, and later inherited control of the man's extensive timberlands and sawmills, substantially expanding the business before selling it to go into construction. He built many of Houston's first skyscrapers, including one in 1916 for Gulf Oil and the National Bank of Commerce that they eventually outgrew, necessitating this replacement.\nGulf relocated to Houston after the city got ocean access by dredging a shipping channel through the bayou, a project Jones led efforts to finance. A major figure in the Democratic party, he headed the Reconstruction Finance Corporation during the Great Depression, rescuing banks and funding New Deal projects, and in 1940 he was named secretary of commerce.\nArchitects Alfred Finn and Kenneth Franzheim collaborated on this highrise, which bears uncanny resemblance to Eliel Saarinen's influential runner-up in the 1922 Tribune Tower contest. A full-length painting of Jones hangs in the main banking hall, where limestone walls set off a brilliant patterned metallic ceiling three stories high.",

        "description": "A woman’s tribute to the husband she loved, and at one time the tallest building in Texas, this highrise commemorates a Danish immigrant who failed twice to get rich discovering gold but ultimately succeeded with oil.\nNiels Esperson was a real estate agent in Oklahoma whose unsuccessful California mining days were behind him when he met Mellie Keenan, a Kansas girl half his age. Married in 1893, the newlyweds lit out for a gold rush in Colorado, but had no luck; Niels even got tuberculosis. While recuperating, he studied petroleum exploration, and finally struck it rich wildcatting at Humble Oilfield near Houston.\nNiels died unexpectedly in 1922 while the couple were in Chicago to meet an architect drawing up a cinema for them. Mellie saw that project through, then commissioned the architect to design this skyscraper across the street in a matching Italian style. She personally throttled up the steam shovel at the groundbreaking. From her 25th floor offices, where she invited associates to join her for tea on the terrace, Esperson remained active in oil and her other diverse business interests for many years.\nEventually she commissioned a second skyscraper next door and named it after herself. By then she had gone blind, so Niels never saw his building, and Mellie never saw hers.",

The artist also did the Art Deco carvings at Houston City Hall, and for the state centennial he sculpted a bronze statue of a Confederate artilleryman who repulsed a Union naval invasion at the Sabine Pass, about 40 miles downriver from Beaumont.\nJefferson County Courthouse stands on land once owned by original settler Nancy Nixon Tevis, near the spot on the Neches River where she operated a ferry. Tevis arrived with her husband and children in 1825, when the sparsely populated land was still part of Mexico and Anglo settlers from the United States were welcomed. Widowed around the time the \"Texians\" revolted against Santa Anna, Tevis later deeded part of her land to found the town, earning her the nickname \"Mother of Beaumont.\"",

Their blank scrolls denote a future yet to be written — one which would turn out to be truncated and tragic for American Insurance Union and its highrise's subsequent owners.\nAIU founder John Lentz, an attorney and former congressman, spun his company's initials into the slogan \"American Ideals Uppermost.\" Rapid growth of his business led Lentz to erect a headquarters identical in height to the Washington Monument. Cost overruns, and then the Depression, doomed AIU. Lentz died in 1931; a day after his funeral, lightning blasted off a piece of the building. Crumbling terracotta eventually forced the removal of four large eagles and four other statuary groups, and left the rooftop cherubs headless.\nInvestors Leslie LeVeque and John Lincoln bought the building in 1946, but LeVeque, who owned an airplane parts factory, and his wife were killed when their plane crashed into a New Hampshire mountain two months later. Their son, Fred, also died in a private plane crash in 1975.\nThe renovated highrise is now a mix of hotel and residential units. Its marble lobby is festooned with colorful murals and has elaborate original bronze elevator doors marked Health, Happiness, and Prosperity.",

        "description": "Generations of sightseers flocked to the rooftop observatory on this pinnacle of Art Deco design until its recent closure. The highrise takes its name from the popular proprietor of a department store that formerly filled five floors at street level.\nJoseph Carew established the city's first Mabley & Carew emporium in 1877. He opened a bigger one in 1889 and built a handsome office block across the street a year later, all facing the \"Genius of Water,\" a monumental bronze fountain and downtown gathering place. For the office construction, Carew demolished a so-called \"nasty corner\" of saloons and rundown storefronts, winning him much admiration and praise.\nDeveloper Jack Emery was only 31 when he announced plans to replace the deceased Carew's Victorian office block with this soaring skyscraper and two more attached: a luxury hotel and a parking garage. The family empire had been founded by Emery's grandfather, who followed the lead of two other Cincinnati entrepreneurs, William Procter and James Gamble, by manufacturing candles out of fat from meatpacking plants that once earned Cincinnati the sobriquet \"Porkopolis.\"\nLong abandoned by Mabley & Carew and a successor store, the office tower is undergoing conversion into residential units.",

Unable to decide whether to call it Union or Central, they turned to their bishop, who suggested they use both. His son, Jesse Clark, rose through the ranks from clerk to controller and finally president as the company prospered making loans and mortgages for farms. \nThe building appears monochromatic from a distance, such as when crossing the John Roebling Bridge — whose eponymous creator later designed the Brooklyn Bridge, another link between Cincinnati and New York. Careful observers may spot faint fragments of the painted accents Gilbert applied to the terracotta, although most has washed away. The pyramidal roof was a favored classical motif of the era modeled after the tomb of King Mausolus of Halicarnassus, a wonder of the ancient world and origin of the word mausoleum. \nOwners converting the tower to apartments have reversed an earlier lobby remodeling that masked the original ornate ceiling and hid bronze elevator doors behind stainless steel.",

Its stone exterior is carved with reliefs of key figures in the history of printing, a theme repeated in the ornamental entryway grill.\nThough he served brief terms in the state house and Congress, Charles Taft preferred to exercise political muscle as editor-in-chief of the newspaper he founded in 1880. Among the causes it promoted was the election of the publisher's younger half-brother, William Howard Taft. Like the famously fat president who went from the White House to the Supreme Court, this building switched careers and is now used by the county judiciary.\nIts sturdy frame was poured by the company that built the world's first reinforced concrete skyscraper in 1903 in Cincinnati. A plaque crediting Samuel Hannaford & Sons for the design is a humble nod by the project's true architect to his grandfather, who designed city hall but was long gone by the time this went up.\nCharles and Anna Taft also did not live to see this building completed; both are memorialized on bronze plaques in its elegant Art Deco lobby. Their former mansion, now an art museum, is a 10-minute walk away.",

Ironically, the immense project was the product of two unmarried brothers so shy they skipped the dedication ceremony and listened to it on the radio.\nOris and Mantis Van Sweringen first found success developing a suburb they dubbed Shaker Heights. Next they bought land downtown and began to connect it to their development via a commuter rail line. Initial plans for a downtown hotel metastasized to a massive office complex, department store, and central underground passenger rail terminal. But suburbanites preferred to drive their own cars rather than take trains, and the Van Sweringens lost control of their sprawling railroad holdings in the Great Depression.\nThe terminal was remodeled into a shopping mall and the department store is now a casino, but the hotel is still operating. The tower, converted to apartments in 2019, still has its gargantuan vaulted lobby and waiting room, and an oak-paneled library and dining room where the brothers once had their daily lunch with senior staff is preserved. From the observation deck on the 42nd floor, it is possible to pick out the distant rising patch of green that is Shaker Heights.",

Besides offices, it was engineered to support multiple floors of heavy automatic telephone switching equipment, which replaced the human operators who had connected calls by hand until then. Ohio Bell reassured the public that its \"girls\" would all be offered new jobs. Their former workplace, a Victorian era office block with a crenelated castle tower, was torn down to make room for the huge Terminal Tower complex.\nThat highrise would soon dominate the Cleveland skyline. But for a few fleeting months, the city's first Art Deco skyscraper — or as one of the local architects responsible dubbed it, \"American Perpendicular Gothic\" — was the tallest building in town. Although the company built a new headquarters closer to the lakefront in 1983, this skyscraper continues to house telephone equipment.",

Ohio Savings Bank & Trust, the biggest financial institution in the city, was one of six Toledo banks to fail in a 1931 panic. \nFor almost 50 years, this asymmetrical edifice in the Lake Erie port known as \"Glass City\" was the headquarters of a major manufacturer of bottles, Owens-Illinois Glass. Bottles were a better business than banks in the Great Depression after Prohibition was repealed in 1933, letting producers broaden their product lines from milk bottles to beer and liquor.\nFounder Michael Owens made a fortune after inventing the world's first fully automated glass bottle making machine in 1903. His company maintained its focus on innovation; the year it moved to this location, it began working with another glass company in New York on an insulation product, fiberglass, they produced through their joint venture Owens Corning.\nDeco gargoyles stud the facade, while two figures in relief flank the arched entrance, one carrying a beehive for industry, the other a gear for technology.",

That was reason enough for the German-American National Bank of Fort Wayne to give itself a patriotic rebrand as Lincoln National Bank during World War I.\nGerman immigrant Charles Buesching was president of the bank when it built this skyscraper, then Indiana's tallest building. He started as a teenage messenger boy shortly after the institution opened its doors in 1905. Clientele included skilled German hosiery workers who came to Fort Wayne to work in its sock factory, Wayne Knitting Mills.\nThe president of that business, Samuel Foster, founded the bank. He was already rich thanks to another clothes factory in town, one he had built to capitalize on a fashion craze for shirtwaists. The button-down blouses were for boys originally, but around 1890 they suddenly became a must-have for every lady.\nPainted tiles decorate this highrise like embroidery on a sleeve. Its spectacular banking hall is appointed with brightly colored murals of a man attired only in a loincloth and a woman who seems to have forgotten her shirtwaist in the dresser.",

        "description": "As dazzling as a movie star's bleached smile, this glazed terracotta highrise towered over every other building in Los Angeles for more than 30 years. Its commanding position was due to a citywide height limit — one from which government buildings were exempt.\nDesigner John Parkinson had drawn up Los Angeles's first skyscraper, the 1904 Braly Building, four blocks down Spring Street. While that 175-foot tower was under construction, Parkinson was picked for a blue ribbon panel on proposed height restrictions. Its recommendations led to a 150-foot limit imposed for half a century, ensuring that the California sunshine beamed bright even downtown, in contrast to the shadowy skyscraper canyons of the east.\nAn English immigrant, Parkinson built fences in Winnipeg and stairs in Minneapolis before his first architectural commission, a bank extension in Napa. He moved on to design schools and commercial buildings in Seattle before settling in Los Angeles, where he enjoyed an enormously prolific career, completing in excess of 200 commissions, of which more than 50 still stand.\nOffsetting the stark exterior is a soaring, arched third-floor rotunda rich with colorful tile mosaics and inlaid marble flooring. The observation deck is open to the public and displays portraits of every mayor since L.A.'s founding.W",

        "description": "Its copper-clad ornamental tower gleams \"like a jewel of jade upon the breast of a Titan goddess,\" gushed one Los Angeles Times reviewer at the opening of this suburban retail temple. \"It's almost sacrilege to call it a store,\" her colleague averred.\nThe five-story flagship was a grand gallery of modern design, displaying ladies' merchandise next to sophisticated murals, eye-catching clocks, and elevators straight out of a Kandinsky painting. Shoppers left their cars with a uniformed valet under a mural-adorned porte cochère to step into a sleek, pink marble hall redolent of perfume samples.\nStore founder John Bullock drove a delivery wagon in his native Ontario before coming to Los Angeles alone as a teenager. He worked in a downtown department store and won over its owner, who encouraged Bullock to open his first store in 1907. Its success led to this establishment closer to Hollywood and other tony neighborhoods.\nLater absorbed by Macy's, this Art Deco landmark closed in 1993 during the New York firm's bankruptcy. Southwestern Law School bought out the lease and extensively restored the property. It now houses faculty offices, a law library in the former sportswear department, and a mock courtroom where well-to-do women once shopped for purses and accessories.",

The partner perished from apparent poisoning that baffled physicians nine years later, but the store, Alexander & Oviatt, prospered until its sole remaining proprietor commissioned this new highrise for it, with leasable offices above and a 10-room penthouse for himself.\nOviatt filled the store with imported French fashion — not just the latest suits, but Art Deco glass sculpture and objets d'art by René Lalique. The Parisien artist also supplied a 30-ton glass ceiling to cover the open-air elevator forecourt. Oviatt even had French sand imported to make a beach by his rooftop pool.\nAt 57, the bachelor clothier was smitten by Mary Richards, a 22-year-old saleswoman, and proposed. They raised a son in the penthouse and spent the rest of their days together. But in his later years, the unabashed haberdasher wrecked his reputation by mailing anti-Semitic screeds to his customers.\nThe restored penthouse is now a wedding venue with many of its original furnishings. The store has been transformed into a swanky lounge where the orchestra plays Roaring Twenties repertoire. It was also the film location where Julia Roberts learned escargots can be slippery little suckers in \"Pretty Woman.\"",

        "description": "If the aqua green tile skin of this highrise seems to come from the same palette as the electric blue Eastern Columbia Building, it is because both Art Deco classics are products of the same architect — one with an uncanny ability to adapt to the times.\nClaud Beelman first worked with tints as a painter in his dad's Ohio carriage shop. As an architect in Los Angeles, Beelman employed virtually every popular commercial style over the decades, from Beaux-Arts to International. Active into his 70s, Beelman got to design the first L.A. skyscraper to rise after voters in 1958 repealed the city's height limit: an 18-story bank slab sheathed in aluminum panels.\nHe was a favorite architect of Sun Realty, which began as the property arm of Sun Drug, a pharmacy chain with locations in office buildings it also owned. In 1924 the president, a Polish immigrant and former tailor named Isidor Eisner, sold the drugstores to a bigger competitor but held onto the office buildings and erected more, including this one, hoping to capitalize on sky-high downtown rental rates.\nWhen rents plunged in the Depression, Sun Realty folded. Its gem of a headquarters has been a retail jewelry exchange since 1978.",

        "description": "Celebrity handprints and footprints at his Chinese Theater are the lasting impression of Hollywood impresario Sid Grauman. But the showman made his first big splash in L.A. with a movie palace in this highrise, where “silent” films were accompanied by a 30-piece orchestra.\nGrauman leased the luxe Million Dollar Theater from building owner Homer Laughlin Jr., heir to a West Virginia ceramics fortune, who also owned the city’s first reinforced concrete office block next door. Each of the theater's 2,300 seats had a switch that activated when someone sat down, lighting up a house diagram so usherettes could direct patrons to empty seats and Grauman could keep an eye on attendance.\nThe building was named for major tenant Southern California Edison, though its fantastical exterior exploding with helmeted cherubs and bison is not what one would expect for an electric company. Nor for the water company, yet William Mulholland, overseer of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, had his offices and boardroom on the top floor too.\nGrauman soon relocated to Hollywood, but his old theater still occasionally screens classic films in its spectacular auditorium. The rest of the building is now converted to residential use.",

        "description": "Gargoyles and stylized flying buttresses on the upper part of this highrise lend a hint of the medieval to a modern structure that once contained ownership records for more than a million parcels of southern California land.\nWhen Edwin Sargent, a Kansas lawyer specializing in legal land title claims, came to Los Angeles in 1886, the city's most recent census had counted 11,000 residents. That would multiply by a factor of ten by 1900, by which time Sargent had helped to organize three companies in the business of certifying land ownership and transfers, laying the groundwork for a real estate boom. By the time the foundations were laid for this company headquarters, the population of Los Angeles had surpassed one million.\nNow converted to apartments, the building has six original lobby murals by Hugo Ballin that depict historic scenes, from a saber-toothed tiger chomping a wooly mammoth in the La Brea Tar Pits to a modern panel of progress where the Title Guarantee Building gets a supporting role. Ballin was a former artistic director for producer Samuel Goldwyn, but left the movie business to concentrate on murals. The women in his paintings are said to bear a resemblance to his wife, Mabel, a silent film actress.",

        "description": "This tower is barely half the height of the spire on the Wilshire Grand, L.A.'s tallest skyscraper. Yet it is historic nonetheless, as the first highrise on the Miracle Mile stretch of Wilshire Boulevard. By luring two department stores five miles from the city center to a site within whiffing distance of the La Brea Tar Pits, Wilshire Tower heralded the age of the automobile.\nThe future thoroughfare was a dirt road flanked by oil wells in 1921, when developer A.W. Wood bought 18 roadside acres. By decade's end, more than 70,000 cars a day motored past his new block-long complex, and more than a few turned to take advantage of its ample rear parking lot. This was the first highrise for architect Gilbert Underwood, who had earned notice with his national park lodges at Yosemite, Yellowstone, and Bryce Canyon.\nDespite anchor stores Desmond's and Silverwoods closing long ago, their rooftop signs remain landmarks in their own right. The tower escaped demolition in the 1980s and recently has been in the midst of extensive renovation. A bronze bust honoring Wood, the prescient developer, stands five blocks west of this building, his signature triumph.",

His grandson Henry de Roulet developed this building on a subdivided parcel of the old family ranch, at the busy intersection of Wilshire and Western — combined in the Wiltern Theater name.\nFilm mogul Jack Warner personally attended the opening night gala for this, the first Warner Brothers cinema in the city's developing western reaches. But poor box office returns prompted the studio to drop its lease not long afterward, and the auditorium hosted a popular Sunday self-help preacher until arrangements were made to bring movies back under new management.\nThoroughly restored with energy efficient technology, the revitalized performance venue has a colorful period lobby and an auditorium dominated by a ceiling sunburst design from which seven stylized skyscrapers sprout. Step into the elevator from the multihued marble tower lobby and you will see the logo of former tenant Desilu Productions, the husband-wife team that created \"I Love Lucy.\"",

        "description": "This speculative venture in commercial real estate for Sun Realty was one of a half dozen properties the developer named after Republican presidents. It has survived repeated financial false starts and long vacancies; the entry doors beneath its elegant wrought iron canopy have been barred for more than 30 years.\nSoon after opening, the building was the scene of front-page news. An attorney there presented a $78,500 settlement check to his client, a Japanese immigrant widow, from the account of Lois Pantages, convicted of manslaughter after killing the woman's husband in a drunk driving crash. The next day, the convicted woman's husband, theater maven Alexander Pantages, was sentenced to prison for sexually assaulting a young dancer. Yet the power couple would each see their convictions overturned, leading many to conclude that justice was for sale in California.\nOne person with few doubts on that score was the widow's attorney, former city council president William Bonelli, who used his fee to settle debts from a failed mayoral campaign. Bonelli then won a seat on the state assembly, and soon used his influence in Sacramento to trade liquor licenses for bribes. When exposed, the corrupt politico fled to Mexico and stayed there the rest of his life.",

        "description": "Though the real mayor of Beverly Hills gave a speech at the opening banquet for this sparkling Spanish civic tower, the main speaker that evening was the former fake mayor, Will Rogers. The popular actor and comedian had pretended to be the elected leader of the movie star enclave a few years earlier, and his short-lived tenure in office proved a hit with constituents.\nRogers, along with his famous neighbors Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, had fiercely and successfully fended off a proposed 1923 annexation into Los Angeles. Three years later in a clear publicity stunt, Rogers was named \"honorary mayor\" by the municipality's trustees. The entertainer delivered headline bait with his tongue-in-cheek proclamations, such as promising a \"Soviet regime\" that would limit every Beverly Hills resident to one swimming pool, six horses, and ten servants.\nThe tower, like Rogers, was also mainly for show. Only the three-story main section was put to use when the building opened, including a library and a jail on the second floor. A prolonged seismic retrofitting has taken the tower offline again, though still accessible is the two-story lobby, with its painted coffered ceiling set off by a wrought iron balcony railing and elaborately rippled moldings.",

        "description": "The first highrise in Santa Monica — and for more than 40 years, the only one — hardly had time to fulfill its intended function before the Great Depression hit. But the clocks that crown its tower have ticked off the hours and minutes ever since.\nFounded by John Rishell in 1921, Bay Cities Guaranty was a savings and loan association that financed a wave of 1920s home construction in the beachfront town with its famous pier. While this building was going up, the board forced Rishell out for financial malfeasance. Acquitted of charges that he stole $10,000 from the company, he was convicted of taking $700 and spent six months in San Quentin before the governor commuted his sentence. Rishell's codefendant and wife, Mabel, the company secretary, was acquitted on both counts.\nDays after Rishell walked free, Santa Monica citizens resoundingly defeated a special ballot proposal to buy the new building and turn it into city hall. The office tower is still in use, and a stylish two-story restaurant and lounge in the former main banking hall has a long zinc bar and some risqué murals of frolicking nudes who seem ready for a round of beach volleyball.",

The social and charitable membership group needed more space to accommodate 2,000 new members.\nThe Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, founded in 1867 in New York by theater professionals, opened its sixth chapter in California's capital city. By the time this building opened, the Elks had a million members nationwide and lodges in almost 1,500 cities and towns.\nPatriotism was a key tenet of the Elks. In the temple's deep purple and gold ceremonial lodge room, iron flagpoles on the dais had forced air blowing through holes to ensure that Old Glory proudly waved indoors. Walter Hicks, a state assessor and holder of the title \"exalted ruler\" at the temple's opening ceremony, served in the artillery in France during World War I, as had his predecessor.\nAfter the Elks sold the building in 1973, it was converted into offices. It is also used as a wedding venue. The top two floors, originally a lounge, have hosted a radio station, a magazine, and a wine tasting room over the years.",

        "description": "With 2,400 incandescent bulbs arrayed along its cornices like candles on a cake, the headquarters of the Oregon Journal has given the Portland skyline a unique glitter for more than a century.\nSince 1951 it has been known as Jackson Tower after Sam Jackson, who acquired the newspaper in 1902 and ran it for two decades as editor and publisher. Jackson positioned it as a Democratic-leaning publication to counter the rival daily, the Republican-backing Oregonian. To design his newspaper's new offices, which stood over the presses in the basement, Jackson commissioned Reid Brothers, San Francisco architects of the Oregonian's own highrise as well as the West Coast's then-tallest skyscraper for the San Francisco Call.\nThe lightbulbs were sometimes employed to signal news — or not, as happened on Election Day 1918. The Journal painstakingly laid out for readers how different illumination patterns that night would indicate various victory scenarios for the Democrats. But a Republican sweep both statewide and nationally left the Journal Building in the dark.\nThe paper moved to new quarters in 1948 and ceased publication in 1982. The tower's offices have largely emptied out in recent years, and the building has been defaced with graffiti.",

        "description": "Framed against the foothills of the Rockies, this highrise was once part of a premier department store. It was built by the founder’s son, whose attention to the family business never quite matched his wanderlust. But loyal to the end, he had an urn of his ashes kept in the tower.\nWilliam Daniels was studying Buddhism in Japan in 1890 when his father died. He dutifully returned to oversee the business, even writing a book on department store management. He also fought in the Spanish-American War, and in 1902 he sailed for South America in a hunt for gold and diamonds. From there he proceeded to England, where he joined a 16-month anthropological expedition to New Guinea. When his wife divorced him for desertion, Daniels married an Englishwoman, Cicely Banner, and continued his world travels.\nTo attract business, Daniels commissioned a replica of St. Mark’s Campanile with an observation deck. The original in Venice was being rebuilt after a 1902 collapse; Daniels made his version one foot taller.\nDaniels & Fisher relocated in 1960 to a modernist shopping complex by I.M. Pei. The old store was torn down — so was Pei's, eventually — but the tower survived. The space behind the four huge glass clock faces can be rented out for parties.",

His modernized gloss on the more historic Gothic style used in the Tribune Tower helped to blaze a new trail for architecture a year before a Paris design expo spawned the term \"Art Deco.\"\nPeople flocked to Bryant Park to inspect the remarkable highrise. The dean of architecture at Harvard deemed it magnificent and daring, though \"open to the charge of vulgarity.\" Painter Georgia O'Keeffe portrayed it in one of her abstract canvases.\nHood praised American Radiator for backing his vision; he had designed radiator covers for the company before his rise to fame. Its president, Clarence Woolley, had cofounded a Detroit predecessor, and grew the home heating conglomerate through European expansion before merging with a maker of bathroom fixtures to become American Standard. The building is now a hotel, and its original radiator showroom in the basement is a cocktail lounge.",

A wraparound bronze frieze at sidewalk level also makes a political statement, depicting an evolutionary procession of amoebas, sea creatures, and geese at a time when fundamentalists were battling to delete Darwinism from schoolbooks.\nBorn in Brooklyn, Irwin Chanin was the oldest child of Jewish immigrants who took their family back to Ukraine for a time before returning in his teen years. Earning an engineering degree at Cooper Union, Chanin went into business as a builder. Houses in Bensonhurst led to Brooklyn office buildings, then Manhattan theaters, including the 6,000-seat Roxy, and a mammoth hotel near Times Square. \nNext came this, briefly the tallest skyscraper in Midtown. \"There's no use going any higher unless you want to see the gates of paradise,\" announced Mayor Jimmy Walker at its dedication, although bigger projects were already underway.\nSculptor Rene Chambellan did the frieze, along with a handsome terracotta band of curling plants above it, plus bronze reliefs of striving men and hyperkinetic radiator grills in the entryways. From the headquarters atop his tower, Chanin designed two landmark apartments on Central Park West, the Majestic and Century, and showed up to work daily until his death at age 96.",

        "description": "As this and a competing skyscraper neared the finish of their race to the clouds in October 1929, headlines blared that the Manhattan Company Building would capture the title of world's tallest. But the Chrysler Building architect knew what reporters did not: Concealed inside his highrise's topmost stories was a 125-foot steel spire waiting to be hoisted up and bolted on.\nWalt Chrysler was a railroad mechanic who rose to executive rank before switching to the nascent automobile industry. He oversaw production for General Motors, then started his own car company and began building a huge factory to compete against GM and Ford. Chrysler also acquired a stalled Midtown skyscraper project and told its designer to make it more eye-catching.\nWilliam Van Alen responded with eagle gargoyles, winged hood ornaments, and tire and hubcap patterns in the brickwork. He replaced a planned glass dome with gleaming stainless steel, and raised the spire like a middle finger toward his former partner, Manhattan Company Building architect Craig Severance, who had dumped Van Alen years earlier.\nThe red marble lobby features ceiling murals of an assembly line and the Chrysler Building itself, which was not universally admired. Influential critic Lewis Mumford savaged it for \"meaningless voluptuousness\" and expressed relief that the Great Depression would halt further displays of rich men's \"barbarous egos.\"",

        "description": "Like a snowcapped mountain peak, this Financial District tower built for the company now known as Citgo has a shining white summit. Terraces where oil executives once conferred now furnish dizzying vistas to penthouse dwellers and patrons of an upscale cocktail lounge and restaurant.\nHenry Doherty quit school at ten and worked at various Midwest utilities before launching Cities Service, a holding company that eventually controlled almost 200 oil, gas, power, light, and streetcar subsidiaries. A self-taught engineer with 150 patents, Doherty also devised a motorized bed for his penthouse that rolled out onto the balcony for fresh air.\nSevere arthritis nearly forced him to retire in 1927, and the top two floors of his skyscraper, originally intended as a new apartment for him, instead became a boardroom and a public observatory. Rather than quit, the longtime bachelor got married and became a crusader for government regulation of oil drilling — which led to laws forcing his company to sell its public utility holdings and focus on petroleum.\nCitgo left decades ago, though its triangle logo can be seen carved into the stone entrances of what is now a luxury apartment highrise. It can also be seen above sculpted aluminum elevator doors in a stunning earth-toned marble lobby .",

        "description": "General Motors board member and major shareholder John Raskob quickly got sick of competitor Walt Chrysler bragging about his world's tallest skyscraper. So Raskob put together a syndicate to erect an even bigger one on the site of the original Waldorf-Astoria.\nHeading the venture was \"Happy Warrior\" Al Smith, the former four-term Democrat governor of New York, whose failed 1928 presidential campaign Raskob had managed. Smith guaranteed publicity and headlines, like when he declared a 200-foot mooring mast on the roof was a serious innovation and not a height-boosting gimmick. Ultimately, no passenger ever dezeppelined via gangway a quarter mile above the sidewalk, and the ostensible airship terminal has been a public observatory ever since.\nAt the opening ceremonies, Smith's gubernatorial successor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, asked jokingly for an office \"so that when I leave Albany I will have someplace to go.\" A year later, Smith tried again for the presidency with Raskob as his campaign manager, but Roosevelt won the nomination and the White House.\nThe building won accolades for its dignified limestone massing, and King Kong famously climbed it in a 1933 blockbuster. High vacancy rates initially earned it the nickname \"Empty State Building,\" and F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote that from its observation deck he had \"the awful realization that New York was a city after all and not a universe.\"",

        "description": "Waves pulse from phantasmagoric figures representing the “spirit of radio\" on the crown of this otherworldly highrise. It was originally commissioned by the Radio Corporation of America, but RCA transferred the still-unfinished building to its parent company after being wooed away to a planned development nearby called Radio City.\nGeneral Electric boss Owen Young created RCA after World War I, when the navy urged him to buy the American subsidiary of Marconi, a British firm dominating wireless transmission. The admirals had military concerns, since the technology was used chiefly for ship-to-shore communications. But the new company rapidly swung its core business to consumer radios and broadcasting, launching the NBC network.\nYoung was an attorney whom GE hired as its counsel in 1912 after he successfully represented utilities suing it. As chairman 20 years later, he was back in court, forced to sell RCA to settle a federal antitrust action. The newly independent radio company moved into 30 Rockefeller Plaza, which for 55 years was called the RCA Building — the name this highrise was meant to carry.\nSoon after Young and GE moved into 570 Lexington, a short circuit in the service elevator lit a blaze that gutted company dining rooms on the upper two stories. Luckily, no one was injured; even the radio spirits survived.",

        "description": "To ensure they captured the title of the world's tallest skyscraper, the developers of this Wall Street highrise named for a bank quietly added five extra stories, an observatory and a 50-foot flagpole to the original plans during construction. But lead architect Craig Severance's bitter rival and former business partner, William Van Alen, stole the glory by cranking a spire out of the roof of his Chrysler Building.\nThe Manhattan Company had its origin in similarly sneaky dealings. Aaron Burr chartered it in 1799 as an operation to supply clean drinking water, but included a clause allowing the company to use surplus capital however it wished. Thus Burr was able to open a bank, ending the monopoly of Alexander Hamilton's Bank of New York. Tensions escalated until Burr killed Hamilton in a duel five years later.\nLease income plummeted with the Depression, and when the original owners, investment banker George Ohrstrom and builder William Starrett, defaulted on the mortgage, their skyscraper was sold for less than they had paid for its elevators. The bank was absorbed by Chase, and its building was nearly vacant in 1995 when Donald Trump bought it and renamed it after himself in what his company calls \"one of the great real estate deals of all time.\" The grand marble former banking hall is now a Duane Reade drugstore.",

Call it apt for a longtime abode of celebrities from Groucho to Bono to Marilyn Monroe, who once sang a sultry \"Happy Birthday\" to Jackie's husband.\nA 1929 state law that permitted towers on multiple dwelling units triggered a burst of the doubled-up configuration, which yielded more windows for penthouses. The first was the San Remo, a Renaissance-style design by hotel architect Emery Roth. While that was underway, Roth was hired to consult on the Eldorado, which mimics the San Remo's shape but with a modern facade.\nLouis Klosk, the project's Bronx-based developer, had his own architects create the Eldorado's Art Deco appearance. Construction commenced weeks after the stock market crashed, and Klosk lost the building a year later. Another pair of Art Deco twin tower apartments, the Majestic and Century, went up at the park's southern reaches before the Great Depression ended the trend.\nThe Eldorado became a co-op in 1982. Only one of its narrow tower tops — the southern one with the trees seen here — contains a penthouse apartment. The other holds a water tank.",

That was absorbed by another institution, which in turn was swallowed up by Williamsburgh Savings.\nCapped with a dome just like the bank's former location, this was long the tallest building in Brooklyn. Its vast banking hall is practically a basilica, with 60-foot ceilings, patterned marble floors, and an enormous glass mosaic map of the island's early Dutch settlements.\nThe teller who served the first customer gave 10-year-old Sonja Rosell a pencil as a souvenir for her $6 deposit, thinking her too young for the silver compact offered to women opening accounts. Another youthful admirer, Miles Morales or Spider-Man, calls this highrise his favorite hangout in \"Across the Spider-Verse.\" He must surely endorse the two cautionary carvings on the facade, which show a safecracker at work on one side and that same crook behind bars on the other.

        "description": "Frank Woolworth was a master of eye-catching displays. His namesake skyscraper, once taller than any man-made structure in the world except the Eiffel Tower, is proof of that.\nRaised on a potato farm, Woolworth struggled with clerking at a dry goods store until the boss had him arrange a table with pens, crocheting needles, harmonicas, soap, and other cheap goods with a sign offering each for a nickel. It was a success, and soon Woolworth was in the five-and-dime business. By 1910, his retail empire numbered 286 stores earning a penny of profit on every sale.\nWoolworth and his company occupied only two floors of this highrise, which faces City Hall and the Brooklyn Bridge. It was mainly for show and rental income — a \"machine that makes the land pay,\" as architect Cass Gilbert put it. Trimmed in creamy terracotta with accents of blue, green, and gold paint, the \"Cathedral of Commerce\" contained enough bricks to pave a road the length of Manhattan.\nVisitors still crook their necks in New York’s most magnificent office lobby. Their gaze rises past golden marble walls to vaulted ceilings adorned with murals and mosaics, supported by a coterie of carved grotesques that depict the men involved in the construction, including Woolworth himself counting nickels and dimes.",

        "description": "A shining lantern beacon marks this highrise headquarters of New York's premier power company. Briefly known as the Consolidated Gas Building, it changed names in 1936 when the utility rebranded in favor of a subsidiary that had grown to dominate the revenue stream.\nCity lights were primarily fueled with coal gas in 1882, when the self-taught inventor Thomas Edison fired up his first electric power station on Pearl Street in Manhattan. Among its first 59 customers was the New York Times, which praised Edison's bulbs that did not flicker or smell and burned much cooler than gaslights. Edison's customer base ballooned, and Consolidated Gas bought his company in 1899 to harness the upstart rival.\nThis highrise was an expansion of adjoining headquarters built in 1914, which explains its matching throwback style. Stone-carved flaming urns on either side of the clocks memorialized 74 employees who died fighting in World War I. The company also developed gas masks for the army during the war, a fact noted at the dedication by its president, George Courtelyou, a former White House stenographer and secretary to three presidents who went on to hold cabinet posts for the commerce and treasury departments before taking the reins at the power company.",

An elegant cast iron balcony at the fourth floor repeats the sunburst motif.\nAfter earning his engineering degree in 1884 from Iowa State, Joseph Porter took a job as an electrician at a power plant in Des Moines associated with Thomas Edison's young company. Before the decade was out, Porter had been promoted to Edison's headquarters in New York. The successful executive was weighing early retirement in 1917 when he was asked to help a foundering Kansas City utility. That kept him busy for another two decades.\nPorter's power company initially occupied nearly the entire tower. It finally moved out in 1991, and the building has been converted to luxury apartments. The marble lobby and mezzanine are brilliantly preserved and now used as an event space.",

Back then, the frontier outpost was the embarkation point for westward travel on the Oregon and Santa Fe trails.\nThomas Smart owned a farm, an inn, and a trading post near the Kansas River levee. He prospered thanks to the constant stream of trail traffic, becoming a county judge and state representative and holding title to extensive acreage in town. The ground under this skyscraper was a wedding gift from Smart to his daughter Harriet on the occasion of her 1866 marriage to Dr. John Bryant.\nThe couple built their first Bryant Building before the turn of the century and replaced with a seven-story successor in 1902. The Bryants numbered among Kansas City's wealthiest landowners; their nephew, Hugh Bryant, was a lawyer who looked after the family holdings and became a major real estate dealmaker in his own right, overseeing construction of this skyscraper.\nNow a regional data center, the building is filled with computer equipment providing network infrastructure for multiple clients. The marble lobby retains its impressive barrel-vaulted ceilings.",

        "description": "When the federal reserve system was created in 1914, Kansas City was chosen for a reserve bank, and its financial sector reaped the rewards. That ultimately was no help for the bank whose name is carved into the limestone facade of this towering slab.\n\"I'd rather be a lawyer than a banker any day,\" said the president of Fidelity National Bank & Trust, Henry Flower, in a 1930 interview as construction got underway on a new headquarters. Flower had practiced law in town for 15 years before a New York financier persuaded him to charter Fidelity in 1899. \nThe bank resided in the old main post office for three decades, leading to the slogan \"Under the Old Town Clock.\" When that was razed for this highrise, the four clock faces were removed, refurbished, and reinstalled on pointed towers at either end. But a year after opening, Fidelity was in liquidation amid rumors that construction costs had helped speed its demise.\nIn a complete reversal, the government then moved into the old bank building, which was a federal office complex for many decades. It is now residential, with large windows in place of the clocks, removed more than 50 years ago.",

        "description": "Dedicating this government tower was the final official act of a county judge named Harry Truman before boarding a train to Washington to be sworn in as Missouri's newest senator. A decade later, he would take the oath of office as America's 33rd president.\nVoters rejected a 1928 bond issue to fund construction of a new courthouse, but passed one to pay for a major road building initiative. Truman administered that project, and after he brought it in on time and under budget, the public rewarded his efficiency by passing the courthouse bond measure when it came up again on the ballot.\nTruman drove across the country seeking civic buildings to inspire the committee of architects, and found a courthouse in Shreveport, Louisiana, that became a model for this. He also chose a sculptor for an equestrian statue of county namesake Andrew Jackson, and even went to Jackson's Tennessee mansion to measure the former president's clothes so his statue would be true to life.\nRichly ornamented with friezes, carvings and a two-story entrance grille, the building also features lovely metalwork on its upper stories that conceals the barred windows of what used to be the county jail.",

Two years after the building's dedication, Pendergast was serving time at nearby Leavenworth for income tax evasion, and Gossett had resigned in the scandalous aftermath.\nMissouri politics is not for the fainthearted. A historic frieze carved on the front of the building depicts Thomas Benton, one of the state's original senators, proclaiming that a great city would be built at the confluence of the Missouri and Kansas rivers. The senator was a key political ally of Andrew Jackson, despite the fact that the future president and hotheaded hero of the War of 1812 had once pulled a pistol on him, provoking Benton's brother to shoot Jackson in the shoulder.",

Older alumni may recall illicit parties in the tower, which stood vacant for decades while its hallways collected empty beer cans and fraternity graffiti.\nContinental Army soldiers and their wives sculpted on terracotta piers symbolize the eponymous firm whose president, Ed Mays, started out as a bank clerk in the Arkansas Ozarks. He soon ran that institution, invested in zinc and copper mines and a factory making barrel staves, and eventually moved to St. Louis for bigger opportunities.\nBesides the insurance firm, Mays was also president of a local bank, Grand National, and commissioned this skyscraper in the city's theater district to house both. To economize, he had the bank's vault door unhinged and moved to its new location here. But robbers found out, and broke into the weakly guarded old vault before its contents were transferred.\nMays paid a ransom to get back most of the loot, but he still lost the bank in the Depression, along with the insurance company and his luxurious two-story penthouse atop this building. He returned dejectedly to Arkansas and resumed the less panic-prone barrel stave business.",

        "description": "Sweeping aside cookie cutter temple templates, Nebraska raised America's first state capitol skyscraper. Their proto-Deco tower on the plains inspired Roaring '20s architects to reimagine how tall buildings ought to look.\nBertram Goodhue had no formal training as an architect, yet his talents as a draftsman landed his firm numerous prestigious jobs, particularly Gothic cathedrals. Going solo in 1914, Goodhue branched into other historic styles, but his winning entry in the 1920 competition for the new Nebraska seat of government \"makes no pretense of belonging to any period of the past,\" he said — it was \"of the here and now, and naught else.\"\nColorful thunderbirds beneath the gold dome pay tribute to Native Americans, as do numerous symbolic decorations in the spectacular interior halls. But a plaque in the top floor memorial chapel also reveals that more Nebraskans were awarded the Medal of Honor for service in the Indian Wars than for any other conflict.\nPowerful sculptures by Lee Lawrie, including the 19-foot \"Sower\" on the dome, and scintillating mosaics overhead and underfoot by Hildreth Meière won both artists many more commissions, including Rockefeller Center. But Goodhue never saw his tower, which took a decade to construct; he died of a heart attack in 1924 at the age of 55.",

It was their second cooperative venture; as teenagers they ran the family newspaper and printing business in Kosciusko, Mississippi, after their father died. They moved to Oklahoma soon after the original Sooners and made separate careers in banking before joining forces.\nTheir bank survived the Great Depression but failed in 1986 in the aftermath of an oil bust that torpedoed its commercial loan portfolio. After a long vacancy, the property was converted to a residential and hotel complex. Penthouses occupy the glass-enclosed 31st story, originally an open-air public observatory that then spent decades as a private supper club.

The tower, topped with a prayer chapel, arose during a Roaring Twenties spate of ecclesiastical construction.\nTwo other showy houses of worship were already underway — a stone-walled Methodist one and a strikingly avant-garde Catholic church — when the Boston Avenue congregation resolved to replace their staid 1907 structure with something thoroughly modern. For creative inspiration, the building committee turned to the high school art teacher, Adah Robinson. \nA talented painter trained at the Art Institute of Chicago, Robinson won over the committee with imaginative concept and design drawings. Bruce Goff, her former pupil who had become an architect and designed a studio for Robinson, was brought aboard to draft the structure under her direction. Another former student, Robert Garrison, executed the sculptural elements to her specifications.\nThe project won Robinson an offer from the University of Tulsa to chair its art department. She stayed nearly two decades, but quit when a new president told her he thought Goff was the church's true architect. Boston Avenue has always credited Robinson alone for the design. She also inspired Mary Cole, the teenage daughter of the church building committee chairman, to become Oklahoma's first licensed female architect.",

Their bank was reorganized into the National Bank of Tulsa during the Depression, a name still engraved in the elegant entrance archway. A successor bank eventually moved out, and the highrise is now called by its address.\nLegend persists, however improbable, that the cupola was once intended as a zeppelin mooring. An actual astounding overhead vision can be found inside, on the arched ceiling of the former banking hall. Supported by square columns of dark Italian marble, it is painted with original murals of delicate, Renaissance-inspired design.",

        "description": "This highrise gets its moniker from oilman Waite Phillips, who also lent his name to his Philcade across the street. A generous if self-referential philanthropist, Phillips donated his Philbrook mansion to the city for an art museum and his Philmont ranch in New Mexico to the Boy Scouts, who still hike its mountain trails.\nPhillips and his identical twin brother, Wiate, left the family's Iowa farm in search of adventure when they turned 16, working in timber and railroad camps, in hotels, and as telegraph messengers. Three years into their trek, Wiate suffered a burst appendix in Spokane, and the twins came home on a train, one of them in a coffin.\nAfter working with his older brothers in the oil business for a time, Phillips went solo. He thus missed out on their company, Phillips Petroleum, but nevertheless made a fortune with his own oil operations in Tulsa. Erecting the state's tallest skyscraper, he had its multicolored tile roof marked with an \"O\" for Oklahoma.\nIn 1941, Phillips gave Philtower to the Boy Scouts to support their New Mexico camp. They later sold the building, now a mix of offices and apartments. The lobby has elaborate Gothic fan vaults and \"WP\" monograms on the elevator doors and doorknobs.",

It stands on Route 66, the celebrated highway that a booster group founded in Tulsa first made famous, and its bright patterned tiles and terracotta vines were meant to add pizzazz not to a jazz club, but to a sprawling farmers market.\nIt was the third such venue owned by John Harden, a paving and concrete business owner and real estate developer who had similar showy shopping complexes in Oklahoma City and Fort Worth. This building replaced a minor league baseball park that briefly served as a refugee camp for thousands of Black victims after mobs burned down 35 square blocks of their neighborhood in the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921.\nThe farmers market was converted in 1935 into the Club Lido dance hall, which also was short-lived. In 1938 it reopened as Warehouse Market, the first of what became a local supermarket chain that continues to this day. But not at this location — the historic facade has been preserved, but the much-truncated building that originally housed 20 stores now only has room for two.",

        "description": "The golden spire rising from this earthy green tower often invites comparisons to a champagne bottle. It also resembles the glaring flame of an acetylene torch, an essential tool for welding steel for skyscrapers — and also the product line manufactured by the original anchor tenant of this highrise.\nUnion Carbide and Carbon, a New York-based chemicals conglomerate, owned several companies involved in acetylene, which burns brighter and hotter than other gases. Oxweld Acetylene, a Chicago subsidiary, produced industrial welding and cutting tools fueled by acetylene and compressed oxygen. The company took ten floors initially and eventually purchased the building, but its parent got the naming rights.\nThe designers took over the firm founded by their late father, Daniel Burnham, the famous Chicago architect whose scores of early highrise designs include the Flatiron Building in Manhattan. He might well have been pleased with his sons' imaginative creation, the first building in Chicago to use colored terracotta cladding.\nIt was converted into a hotel in 2004, and its lofty entryway and marble elevator lobby are extensively restored. A 24th floor rooftop cocktail lounge allows guests to contemplate the tower's shiny tip from a closer vantage, the better to admire how sunlight glints on its gold leaf highlights.",

        "description": "The sons of two of Chicago’s most celebrated architects designed this highrise at the spot where Michigan Avenue bridges the Chicago River. The mostly ramrod-straight thoroughfare deviates slightly from its course there, a fortunate jitter that makes the stylish landmark visible the full length of the Magnificent Mile.\nJohn Root and William Holabird were responsible for some of the first skyscrapers ever built. Their sons, both named John, were also part owners of this slender slab just 60 feet wide, and their firm occupied offices near the top. The building was inspired by Eliel Saarinen’s second-place entry in the Tribune Tower contest, the younger Root acknowledged.\nIt stands on the former site of Fort Dearborn, and the developers considered historic names before deciding \"333\" was more mellifluous. Instead, history is expressed through life-size frieze panels of pioneers, settlers, and Native Americans carved in the limestone between the windows on the fifth story.\nNowadays the public is welcome for drinks at the once-private Tavern Club on the 25th and 26th floors. In 1933 the establishment hosted a tremendous beer bash as the long-awaited end of Prohibition finally hove into view. Two months later, in a more sobering moment, attorneys for the building filed for bankruptcy.",

        "description": "When the world's largest commodities exchange was also Chicago's tallest skyscraper, tourists flocked to observatory windows that once lined the base of its roof. More thrills awaited in the cavernous main trading hall, where they could watch traders in the chaotic pits shout and signal their buy and sell orders for bushels of corn, wheat, and soybeans.\nThe exchange was founded in 1848 by grain brokers and dealers to bring stability and standardization to unruly markets. Initially meant to establish prices for immediate sales, the exchange soon introduced futures contracts for hedging and speculating on where prices would be in months to come.\nCarved figures on the limestone exterior recall the ancient farmers who first cultivated grains. Above them perches 33-foot-tall Ceres, a faceless, modernist version of the Roman harvest deity. Two more iterations of her are below: a classical statue from the former exchange now in a courtyard, and a huge mural that once hung in the trading hall and is now in an atrium, depicting an athletic goddess sowing seeds while topless.\nThe rooftop deck closed in 1971 and the pits are gone too, replaced by computer trading. But the skylit lobby still feels futuristic, lined by blocky black marble columns inlaid with metal strips and third-floor balconies perched on rippling cascades of buff stone.",

        "description": "The claim of this holy highrise to be the world's tallest church depends on whether one overlooks that most of its floors are office space, not sacred space. It played a pivotal role in Chicago's skyline by shattering a strict municipal height limit and unleashing a flood of skyscrapers.\nWhen city officials gave the Methodist church that had long occupied the site special permission to exceed their 400-foot boundary with a new building in 1922, it provoked outrage from the Chicago Tribune, which had just held a skyscraper design contest  sticking to the limit. Within months, council opened up the sky to new construction, and the Trib had its winning architects tack an extra four stories onto their blueprints.\nRev. John Thompson, the English-born pastor who championed this structure, said his church was not only the tallest but also the richest in terms of lease income. A stunning vaulted sanctuary in the base of the tower seats 500 and has artificially lit stained glass windows not visible from the outside. The impressive tenant entrance has Gothic stone caps over the elevators and a painted beam ceiling.\nA chapel just beneath the steeple, used only for special occasions, has an altar carving of Christ in the clouds beholding the skyscrapers of Chicago — and smiling.",

Its ornate crown once housed a speakeasy, while its stocky base contained one of the country's biggest indoor parking garages.\nExhibitors at a national jewelry trade show held here when it opened must have been impressed with the imposing marble lobby and 15-foot coffered ceilings. But an unexpected anchor tenant took the naming rights along with six floors, so by the time the president of the Chicago Jewelers Association unveiled an eight-ton Father Time clock donated by a prestigious watch manufacturer and mounted above the sidewalk, it was hanging from the Pure Oil Building, a name that stuck for almost 40 years.\nAn original brochure claimed the skyscraper \"typifies the goldsmith's art.\" Chicago architecture critic Carl Condit reckoned it to be \"recklessly extravagant\" and \"orgiastic.\" The evil Decepticons liked it well enough to make it their base for Earthly domination in the blockbuster \"Transformers: Dark of the Moon.\"\nThe architects had worked on numerous marquee projects for Daniel Burnham's firm, including the Flatiron Building in New York, and launched their own practice after his death. This was their last collaboration.",

        "description": "Like the red fezzes Shriners wear at parades, the Moorish dome and minaret capping this highrise are all part of the fraternal organization's Middle Eastern theme. Built to provide recreation facilities, banquet space, and 440 guest rooms for Chicago's largest masonic group, the eclectic skyscraper has been a hotel for most of its existence.\nA Shriners children's hospital in Oak Park and country club in DuPage County were both underway in 1925 when plans for this building, three blocks from the Medinah Shrine on Wabash Avenue, were announced. Mayor \"Big Bill\" Thompson broke ground two years later with the club tower’s president, Thomas Houston, an insurance man who headed Thompson's civil service commission. In 1931, Houston was named imperial potentate of all Shriners in America; two months later, he was bounced from the presidency of his athletic club, which had defaulted on its loans and eventually filed for bankruptcy. \nThe tower first was remodeled into a hotel in 1944. After a series of owners, it underwent extensive restoration and reopened as the Hotel InterContinental in 1990. Lavishly decorated inside and out, the building especially leans into its stonemasonry heritage. Three Mesopotamian-inspired friezes wrap around the building and depict scenes in the construction of a great temple.",

        "description": "This radically barefaced brick building is the world's tallest masonry-only skyscraper, resting on six-foot foundation walls with no steel skeleton to hold it up. Named after an isolated New Hampshire mountain, the monolithic highrise is a distant ancestor of countless less-is-more rectangles, yet is undeniably unique.\nDaniel Burnham and John Root had designed the elegant Rookery office building for Boston-based owners Peter and Shepherd Brooks. Its decorative stone carvings won many admirers, but Peter Brooks was not among them. The older brother felt ornamentation cost extra and collected dirt and roosting pigeons, so for this project he went solo and demanded: Keep it simple.\nRoot's initial sketches were rejected as too elaborate; while he was away on a beach holiday, Burnham produced a stark design that passed muster. The building filled up so rapidly that Shepherd bought an adjoining lot for an extension to double its size, using different architects since Burnham was busy planning the Chicago World's Fair. The Monadnock became the most profitable property the brothers ever owned.\nThe meticulously restored interior has rooftop skylights through which light floods down onto stairwells trimmed with ornamental cast aluminum — one decorative detail that survived the stinginess of Peter Brooks.",

Palmolive, named after the two oils that are its key ingredients, was launched in 1898 by a Milwaukee soap maker whose perfumed bars became so popular that the company relocated to Chicago and commissioned a sleek highrise headquarters in 1927.\nLater that year, the company launched the \"Palmolive Hour\" and signed soprano Virginia Lea to star as featured singer \"Olive Palmer.\" The radio show was broadcast from WGN studios in the swanky Drake Hotel, across the street from the skyscraper construction site. Its success spurred more programs written by and for women, including short melodramas sponsored by detergent makers — or as they soon came to be known, soap operas.\nOriginal carved wood elevator panels depicting nubile women bathing in jungle surroundings must have appealed to Hugh Hefner, who bought the lease in 1965 and made the building Playboy headquarters for over 20 years. \nIt is now luxury condominiums. A revolving aviation beacon on the roof became a nuisance once taller buildings like the John Hancock Center sprang up in the neighborhood. The spotlight now confines its sweep to the skies over Lake Michigan. ",

A second attempt at a Pittsfield dry goods store went so well that he was offered a partnership. Spurning it, Field lit out for Chicago and built his retail empire. Its flagship store stands a block away from this building, which housed doctors and dentists for most of its existence. The tower was later given to the city’s natural history museum, which Field had also established, though museum trustees eventually sold it.\nIn 1992, the Chicago River burst into an underground tunnel network linking old buildings in the Loop, including the Pittsfield. More than 20 feet of water flooded its basement, forcing a temporary evacuation.\nA residential conversion is partially complete, but has been plagued by delays and legal wrangles.

It's a pity, because the entrance is splendid, surrounded with limestone relief panels of the history of commerce by Chicago artist Gwen Lux and an exquisite cut lead grille overhead with silhouettes of farmers, riveters, lumberjacks, and other laborers.\nInside, two more Lux panels flanking a red marble main staircase reveal the rationale of the consumer mortgage bank that built this tower. One shows a workingman cradling a miniature house, with the legend \"Life prospers the thrifty.\" On the other side, a balding, shoeless figure glares ruefully above the legend \"Life punishes the thriftless.\"\nLife prospered and punished John Corcoran, who founded Trustees System Service in Birmingham, Alabama, to offer mortgages to working people. He grew it to 24 branches, relocated to Chicago, and commissioned this tower, but the bank failed in the Depression a few years later. Corcoran and five other company officials, including his brother, were accused of deceiving investors. The case was thrown out on a technicality, and prosecutors dropped the issue since the Corcorans had lost their own money in the crash too. The longtime office building is now fully residential.",

Profits from what ads called \"the finest flavored gum on Earth\" and succeeding flavors like Spearmint paid for this ivory highrise, inspired by the buildings that had given the fair its nickname — the White City.\nWilliam Wrigley Jr. had a baking powder business in Chicago, offering chewing gum and other premiums to help move his wares until he decided he could make more money selling the gum. He was right, and when the city began to extend Michigan Avenue northward, Wrigley bought a parcel at the new DuSable Bridge. \nHis skyscraper was shaped to fit the trapezoidal parcel, making its angled facade visible all along the city's main thoroughfare. To make sure everyone noticed, it pushed against the 400-foot height limit and was wrapped in graduated shades of white terracotta to make it glow; by night, it was bathed in floodlights. Wrigley also sponsored a bridge sculpture of Marquette and Joliet, the first white people to see the Chicago River, and the native Illini who showed it to them.\nFour generations of Wrigleys headed the business before it was bought by Mars. It moved out of the building in 2011, but the deal required the new owners to keep the historic name.",

        "description": "When University of Michigan alumni started wondering about the fate of bells that had rung from a campus campanile until it was torn down for a new library, the president proposed building another tower for them to honor those killed in World War I. Instead it was the president himself who got the honor.\nMarion Burton took the top post at Ann Arbor in 1920 after leadership terms at Smith College and the University of Minnesota. He oversaw much growth and construction on campus, and in 1924 had the distinction of nominating his friend Calvin Coolidge for president at the Republican national convention. Months later, however, Burton became severely ill with pneumonia and died at the age of 50. \nEfforts were launched to fund a tower in his memory, but they were stalled by the Great Depression until a banker alumnus donated a 53-bell carillon. The old bells were melted down in a World War II scrap drive.\nInside the tower are classrooms and offices that housed the music department until it got its own building on the north campus in 1964. A second university carillon there has 60 bells.",

        "description": "The president of the bank that ordered this highrise had an ulterior motive. When it became the tallest building in town, it surpassed a tower just down the street named after his older brother.\nWiley Reynolds was first in line to take over the bank his father founded, but instead started a factory in 1899 to make cushion springs for buggies, and soon, automobiles. He succeeded in this and further ventures, from plastics to real estate, and commissioned the 14-story Reynolds Building, the tallest thing in Jackson.\nMeanwhile, Herbert Reynolds, two years Wiley’s junior, succeeded their father at the bank in 1903. When his bank’s tower topped his brother’s, Herbert was able to gloat for two years until the bank failed; he was forced into early retirement and died in 1939. Wiley’s plant prospered and expanded to supply military contracts during World War II; he died in 1948 aboard his yacht in Florida.\nThe county occupies the building, and has restored the former banking hall's intricate barrel-vaulted ceiling and arched stained glass windows modeled after ones in a Florentine palazzo. The parks department rents the space for weddings and other events.",

        "description": "The auto pioneer who created America's first mass-produced car built this highrise across the street from the Michigan state capitol. An electric carillon on top used to play \"In My Merry Oldsmobile,\" a tune that delighted Ransom Olds.\nThe first primitive “horseless carriages” Olds invented ran on steam power to hawk the engines his factory manufactured. He also experimented with battery-powered cars, but ultimately decided a gasoline engine worked best. Thousands of the first Oldsmobile were sold starting in 1901. Their creator touted the environmental and safety benefits of automobiles versus horses, which stank up city streets and were sometimes prone to bolting.\nOlds left his company in an ownership dispute and launched a second automaker. Its popular light truck, the REO Speed Wagon, gave its name to a popular light rock band. Olds also founded a bank that was in the base of this tower briefly until it folded in the Great Depression.\nA successor bank, Michigan National, bought the building after Olds died and renamed the tower after itself. When that bank was absorbed in a merger, the building was again renamed for its owners: Louie Boji, a developer who immigrated from Iraq in 1968, and his son and business partner Ron.",

The highrise was built by another person who wound up far from the place of his birth.\nJacob Kovinsky was a child when his parents left their Russian shtetl and immigrated to Canada. As a boy, he sold eggs and sewing supplies and helped with his father's metal business before starting his own scrap metal concern in Pontiac. An early carriage and automobile manufacturing center, the city had ample resources for such a business, and Kovinsky did well. He was vice president of the Peoples Savings Bank of Pontiac during construction of this building, and purchased it before it was finished.\nThe building housed a successor bank after Peoples failed in the Depression; another owner later renamed it Oakland Towne Center after the county in which it is located.

At least the god of the forge has a leather apron to partially shield his modesty.\nAlabama Power was founded in 1906 by William Lay, a riverboat captain who mapped out rapids and shoals where hydroelectric dams could go. He started to build one on the Coosa River southeast of Birmingham, but had to hand over control of his company to finance the project, which began service in 1914 and was later named Lay Dam.\nAnother promising company site, at Muscle Shoals on the Tennessee River, was handed over to the federal government during World War I for a dam meant to power an explosives manufacturing plant. The nitrates factory was eventually built elsewhere, but the dam became the centerpiece of the Tennessee Valley Authority, one of Franklin D. Roosevelt's most heralded domestic achievements.\nThree carved figures over the entrance bearing gifts of a transmission tower, the sun, and fire are labeled Power, Light, and Heat.

        "description": "German immigrant merchant Christian Enslen erected this skyscraper on the site of his first bank, which he had founded in 1885. When the new highrise was completed, Enslen had retired to become chairman, having handed the presidency to his son, Eugene.\nBoth men were re-elected to their posts at the institution's first annual meeting held in its new skyscraper. But two weeks later, depositors were greeted with a notice on the locked front door announcing the state banking board had shut the doors. The elder Enslen passed away a few months later, shortly after the institution reopened under new management.\nThe top three floors opened as a lavish private newspaper club with a rooftop restaurant and promenade, and for a brief period the building became the headquarters of a local newspaper. It was rededicated as the City Federal Building in 1963 after a new bank took over, and shortly thereafter it lost the title of Alabama's tallest office tower that it had held for five decades. Today it is mostly condominiums, and the medical offices on the ground floor still preserve elements of the original marble banking hall.",

        "description": "Depending on who is doing the talking, this highrise stands on the “heaviest corner in the South” or the “heaviest corner on Earth.” The boast about big skyscrapers clustered at this intersection originated in Jemison Magazine, a promotional publication put out by developer Robert Jemison, whose father erected this daintily painted terracotta office tower.\nHype came naturally to Birmingham, a young industrial city named by its founders after the famous British nexus of 19th century steel production. It was founded after rich seams of coal, limestone, and iron ore — the three main ingredients for steelmaking — were discovered in nearby Red Mountain.\nThe elder Jemison built a fortune investing in street railways and suburban development in town. He built this office tower on the former site of a saloon that closed when, in rapid succession, the city, county, and state outlawed alcohol.\nNow a boutique hotel, it takes its name from an older town Birmingham swallowed up. The entrance is flanked by the original pink granite columns. An iron and marble staircase and chandeliers are also as they were on opening day. By far its best feature, however, is the rooftop bar, which allows a rare closeup view of the colorfully painted terracotta cornice. ",

But the elevator lobby's rose marble walls and chandeliers hung from a vaulted ceiling stenciled with heraldic symbols hint at what the Birmingham News praised when this highrise opened as \"such grandeur that kings and queens would glory in treading it.\"\nThe building, with its peaked copper roof, was constructed for an insurance company founded by William Jelks. An influential newspaper publisher who had used his media platform as a springboard into politics and eventually the governor's mansion, Jelks was an ardent white supremacist and led efforts to pass a Jim Crow state constitution in 1901 that disenfranchised Black citizens for generations. Sharing a stage with Booker T. Washington on Negro Day at the 1906 state fair, Governor Jelks accused Black schools of encouraging sloth and entitlement and declared that \"less reading and more honesty would be a good slogan\" for his listeners.\nThe architects put their offices on the seventh floor. Its Gothic stone lobby has been well preserved, with groin vaulting, polychrome tile and marble floor, and leaded glass doors and windows.",

When the time came to replace it, this new highrise's steep roof was a reminder of its lineage.\nThe most celebrated person in the Watts family tree was not a Watts, but Charles Linn, a Swedish immigrant who built an iron works and then a bank in the post-Civil War boomtown. The land where the first Watts Building was built was a gift to his oldest daughter, Ellen Linn Watts. \nWatts, widowed in her 30s, owned the property for over four decades, leaving it to her son in 1921. Months after her death, he was killed in a hunting accident, so it went to his widow, Julia Glass Watts, and her son, Thomas, a World War I veteran who had started a tire and lube business. They commissioned the skyscraper, but Julia died the next year, so only Thomas saw it completed.\nIt was the last office building in the city to employ elevator operators, who in 1990 still closed the doors by hand and started the cab with a crank. At the decade's end, it was converted to residential units.",

        "description": "The top presidential suite in this stately hotel is named for George Merrick, who founded a Mediterranean-themed planned community on a family citrus grove that his father had named after the locally abundant construction material he used to build their house there.\nMerrick teamed with the expanding Biltmore chain to build a luxury golf course and resort property as an anchor for his suburban development. Its central tower was modeled on the Giralda, a famed Spanish cathedral belfry that had its origins as the minaret of a grand mosque.\nWhile his hotel was under construction, Merrick also donated land and money to found the University of Miami. The school's football team would soon take its name from the devastating hurricane that struck in 1926, turning the months-old luxury hotel into a temporary shelter for homeless Coral Gables residents. The storm also squashed a south Florida land boom and cost Merrick most of his fortune.\nThe Army took over the property during World War II, and it was used as a veteran's hospital for nearly three decades. Long ago restored to its original purpose, the hotel features a magnificent blue vaulted lobby where tropical finches in elaborate birdcages tweet for the guests checking in.",

It was erected during a 1920s construction boom as the headquarters of Dade County Security Company, a mutual building and loan association.\nFounder Frederick Morse was an early settler in south Florida, having arrived in 1880 from Boston in search of a climate more amenable to his frail constitution. He took a job with the Florida East Coast Railway when it was extending its line south, and became president of the first city council in Miami after its 1896 incorporation.\nWhen the financial institution was ready to expand, the board chose the vice president's cousin, New York architect Robert Greenfield, to design its skyscraper. Greenfield soon secured further commissions in town, leading him to open a new office in Miami.\nA series of banks succeeded the original owners, triggering building name changes from Pan American to Metropolitan to Capital. The granite and terracotta office tower was briefly the Miami hub of WeWork before the coworking space provider's death spiral. Its two-story banking hall has been thoroughly gutted and stripped down to the ductwork in an industrial chic makeover.",

James Cox suffered one of the most humiliating routs in presidential election history, but bounced back to build a media empire.\nCox was an Ohio newspaper publisher who made it to the governor's mansion before losing the 1920 White House race in a landslide to another Ohio newspaper publisher, Warren Harding. After the debacle, Cox wintered in Miami and loved it so much that he bought a house there and a local newspaper. When he saw plans unveiled for the Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables, Cox hired its architect to design a similar Mediterranean-themed building for his Miami Daily News.\nThe paper frequently tweaked Al Capone, who had a mansion on the bay, and Cox claimed he was the one who tipped off the feds to go after “Scarface” for income tax evasion. After the newspaper relocated, the federal government leased the property; it became the processing center for floods of Cuban refugees fleeing Fidel Castro's revolution. Renamed Freedom Tower, the building is now part of the regional community college and flies a Cuban flag next to the Florida and U.S. standards.",

One inmate in 1939 used a rope left there by a paint crew to rappel down the tower and escape; later concerns about suspicious \"sightseers\" passing hacksaw blades through the cell windows led to permanent closure of the observation deck.\nCourtrooms have seen their share of historic \"Florida man\" trials. A death penalty case five years after the courthouse opened involved the would-be assassin of Franklin D. Roosevelt; the Italian immigrant bricklayer shot at the president-elect at a Miami rally, but missed and killed the mayor of Chicago instead.\nRenovation efforts have restored mosaics in the lobby and a ceremonial sixth-floor courtroom, but court officials decided in 2017 that the building is obsolete and needs to be sold. In the meantime, a taller courthouse skyscraper has gone up across the street, effectively blocking any sunset views from the long-abandoned promenade.",

        "description": "It should have been a triumphant moment for Mayor Isaac Ramsdale when he formally accepted the keys to this municipal highrise and toured its gleaming marble halls. But the building by then was also in the spotlight of a graft probe that would send two city council members to prison and make the mayor a lame duck.\nA bond to fund it passed overwhelmingly and construction was underway when, during a city council meeting in late 1929, an alderman griped about council wanting payoffs to pick a wiring contractor. Councilman Harry York berated the man, who recanted. That did not satisfy the publisher of the Atlanta Constitution, Clark Howell, who immediately penned an editorial demanding further investigation.\nA grand jury report finding widespread corruption was issued the month before the new city hall opened, and York was the first of several officials convicted in the trials that followed. A year later, the Atlanta Constitution won a Pulitzer Prize for its role in uncovering the scandal.\nThe mayor and council moved to an adjacent annex in 1986, but the city still uses this highrise. Its lobby features extravagant Gothic decorative elements, such as pointed bronze arches above the elevator doors.",

        "description": "The tallest state capitol in America suits its champion, the grandiloquent populist Huey Long, who became governor and then senator in no small part due to big public works projects like this. Ironically, just as Long seemed on a path to the White House, he was gunned down in this very building.\nA lawyer on the state public utility commission who honed his oratory arguing before the U.S. Supreme Court, Long played up his humble country origins to voters. Elected at age 34 as the state's youngest governor, Long made plenty of enemies, including Standard Oil, which he tried to tax to fund a raft of progressive social programs. But an impeachment of Long for abuse of power failed, and he pushed through funding for free textbooks, hundreds of miles of highways, a railroad bridge over the Mississippi, and the new capitol.\nLouisiana's state skyscraper supplanted Nebraska's in height; like its Midwestern cousin, the Baton Rouge tower is also richly carved with allegorical figures, friezes, and historical statuary — plus a passel of pelicans, the state bird. Visitors can scan horizons from the 27th floor observation deck, observe bullet damage in the main hall's marble walls from Long's assassination, and make a pilgrimage to the martyred leader's grave in the formal gardens.",

The copper-topped cupola, designed to hold the water tank with panache, provides a modern contrast to the classical one on the slightly older Hibernia Bank a block away.\nAnother neighbor, the 10-story Hennen Building across the street, dates from 1895, laying claim to the title of the South's first skyscraper. Much changed in the intervening three decades from its erection to this highrise, but both were built on top of an underground forest of wooden pilings driven into the swampy soil. So stands steadily the sole Art Deco skyscraper in a city whose architectural style usually hews to tradition.\nThe original American Bank & Trust brass entrance gate leads from the marble elevator lobby into the banking hall, which is no longer in use. The institution was renamed National American Bank in 1949, and later spent time as a Bank One before it emptied out. Destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina led to huge demand for replacement housing, and the vacant tower was converted into an apartment complex.",

Though eclipsed by taller structures for decades, it remains an icon of the New Orleans skyline.\nA group of Irish-American businessmen founded the bank in 1870, choosing an Emerald Isle harp for their logo. Their chief shareholder and vice president was Hugh McCloskey, who had immigrated with his brothers from Londonderry and prospered with a grocery and cold storage business. McCloskey also became a major player in developing the city's cable car network, still in operation today. He was serving as chairman of the bank when it debuted this new headquarters in its 51st year of existence.\nThe banking hall maintains its original monumental feel, with two dozen marble Corinthian columns 30 feet tall supporting a dramatic coffered ceiling. The rest of the building has been converted into apartments, with a pool on one rooftop. The uppermost floor, originally intended as an executive dining room, is now a penthouse, and each night its balcony is awash in the glow of the cupola, illuminated in the traditional Mardi Gras colors of purple, green, and gold.",

        "description": "Standing across the street from Mississippi governor's mansion, the first skyscraper in Jackson was built for the state's first insurance company, which claimed it sold its first policy to a previous occupant of the state executive residence.\nThe founders of Lamar Mutual Life Insurance named their company after Lucius Lamar, a lawyer and politician who served under Jefferson Davis in the Confederacy and later became a U.S. Supreme Court justice. The company's first cashier and secretary in 1906, Christian Welty, was general manager and vice president by the time of this building's opening. He was hailed then for his scolding letter to the editor printed in a Memphis newspaper after its cartoonist mocked insurance salesmen. Welty's daughter, Eudora, would have even more success with her published work, winning a Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for her novel \"The Optimist's Daughter,\" set in a Jackson suburb.\nThe insurance company originally occupied the 9th and 10th floors, and every floor had a hall clock synchronized with the large clock faces on the tower. Now a mix of offices and apartments, the building is ornamented with cheerful gargoyles and a row of smiling bearded busts of a balding man who bears a striking resemblance to Lamar himself.",

        "description": "The Mississippi architect who designed this exemplary Art Deco highrise relocated his offices to its top floor from previous quarters three blocks away atop the Lamar Life Building. Though that skyscraper is only five years older, the two seem ages apart.\nLeading the group of investors who commissioned this building was Edward Flowers, who had married the daughter of a sawmill and lumber baron and assumed control of the business after his father-in-law's death. Originally given a generic geographic moniker, the tower was rechristened in 1952, after a Jackson insurance company followed Claude Lindsley's lead and relocated from its own previous skyscraper headquarters across town. \nStandard Life was acquired three decades later by a New Jersey insurer that eliminated its 159 local jobs and left the tower mostly vacant. But the name and electric sign stuck, and the property was eventually converted into apartments. Its brilliantly restored lobby of black and gold marble and nickel-plated copper deserves the description one newspaper gave at its grand opening, when hundreds of spectators endured a rainstorm to see for themselves \"a labyrinth of beauty that the eye is unable to absorb in one glance.\"",

Wolfe's father had owned a monument business on the lot where this highrise went up, so the author's critique may have been directed at its namesake, L.B. Jackson.\nRoadsides in western North Carolina were once peppered with signs urging tourists looking to buy their own Blue Ridge retreat to \"See L.B.\" Only 27 when he commissioned the city's first skyscraper, Linwood Baldwin Jackson was a born salesman, starting at the age of eight with bags of peanuts outside his father's store. When his dad took a job managing a soda bottling plant, Jackson hawked the product, Chero-Cola, then invented, patented, and sold a device to light and inspect the bottles for imperfections.\nAfter further bulking up his capital stash selling lottery punchboards, Jackson jumped into real estate development. The Great Depression wiped out his fortune temporarily, but he eventually went back into construction and kept an office on the ground floor of his Jackson Building.",

In 1913 he launched a new product, a pre-rolled cigarette blending American and Turkish leaves. His assistant went to the traveling circus in town and got a photograph of their dromedary, \"Old Joe,\" that became the logo for Camel cigarettes.\nMarketed nationally and priced below the competition, the popular brand drove the company's rapid growth. Its new headquarters had custom plumbing and wiring installed on two floors to entice doctors to lease offices there.\nCarved wooden ceilings in the marble elevator lobby still have a tobacco leaf motif, though the company moved out in 2009 to new quarters on the same block. Now its old highrise is part residential, part upscale hotel — with a no smoking sign in every room.",

This highrise was built for a company that served its factory workers, selling accident insurance through the then-novel practice of payroll deductions.\nThe Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company was acquired shortly after its founding by Thomas Maclellan, an immigrant Scottish banker. His son, Robert, succeeded his father as president and oversaw the firm's expansion into general health insurance. He also added a lucrative customer base: Chattanooga choo choos. As one of the country's leading insurers of railroad workers, Provident commissioned its first permanent headquarters, with elevators that were outfitted like Pullman sleeper cars in recognition of their importance to the business.\nTwo more Maclellans would go on to run the company, and when it moved to new headquarters in town, the old headquarters was renamed after the influential family. Now residential, the building has a restored marble and brass lobby. An office tower and a theater flanking it were designed by the same local architect, and together they form a fetching procession of facades along the boulevard.",

The first two are familiar symbols of buying and selling; the latter was the chief unit of exchange for cotton picked in the Mississippi delta, compressed, trussed, and shipped here to be traded at its main market.\nThis was hailed as the tallest building in the South when it went up, and both the sitting governor and his immediate predecessor attended the opening banquet. Their dedication speeches couldn't match the verbosity of John Sneed Williams, president of the exchange, who hailed the tower whose construction he had overseen as \"a structure sublimely beautiful, and so enduring that her proud head shall still be thrust sunward girt in the habiliments of supernal youth when the pyramids of yon ancient Egyptian Memphis are but a reminiscent glory.\"\nThe top two stories housed the private Chickasaw Club, which held its spring ball a month after the opening. Reportedly almost no bouquets were used as decoration that evening, the venue being judged sufficiently beautiful already — or perhaps Williams's oration had been flowery enough. Despite his rapture, the exchange relocated two blocks down the street a decade later, and today the building is a mix of residential units and hotel lodging.",

While he enjoyed the view from his top-floor office here, Lloyd Binford kept a critical eye out for movies he deemed offensive enough to ban as chairman of the local censorship board.\nThe first was Cecil B. DeMille's \"King of Kings,\" which Binford barred from Memphis cinemas in 1928 over concerns it was antisemitic and could provoke civic unrest. The fear of stirring up a riot was also Binford's rationale for censoring films that suggested racial equality. Musical features were snipped clean of Cab Calloway, Lena Horne, and Duke Ellington, while \"Annie Get Your Gun\" was nixed for having a train conductor who was Black.\nUnited Artists took Binford to the Tennessee Supreme Court when he banned a 1947 comedy showing a mixed-race classroom. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to rule in that case, but the next decade the justices declared school segregation unconstitutional.\nFor many years known as Lincoln American Tower after a merger, the building is now residential and has a new name. The original company initials are on the elevator doors and an ornamental balustrade in the restored marble lobby.",

Visiting the construction site in 1929, Sterling joked that his highrise would look better in Houston, and declined to confirm rumors he would run for governor of Texas.\nSterling did run the next year, and won. That same year, the biggest oilfield yet was discovered in east Texas. So many gushers flooded the market that crude oil prices plummeted to 2 cents a barrel, and the new governor declared martial law to stop drillers from violating production limits. Sterling lost the next election and also his Tennessee tower, which was auctioned on the courthouse steps two years after opening.\nNumerous renovation attempts and ill-considered paint jobs by prior owners have failed to restore the Sterick to its intended glory. The new owner plans to convert it into residential units, a project that will take several years.",

Founders included a department store owner, a furrier, and a leather merchant.\nWilliam Schwarzschild, bank president when the bank opened this new highrise, had grown a watch repair business into a fine jewelry store with his brother, Gus, before taking the reins at Central National. Both he and the bank's first president, Charles Hutzler, were sons of Jewish immigrants who made a living in the retail clothing business. Schwarzschild was succeeded as head of the bank by his son, Harry.\nPatterns of colored tiles along the building's crown, as well as a splashy multihued coffered ceiling in the main banking hall, are the work of New York architect John Eberson, best known for his movie palaces. He had recently completed one in Richmond that is still used today for theatrical productions when he received this commission.\nA successor bank eventually sold the building. It stood vacant for more than a decade before being converted into apartments in 2016.",

        "description": "Sharing the same block with the state's first skyscraper, this highrise was built six years after it by the same family on the grounds of their original homestead. Georg and Gretchen Luhrs, German immigrants who opened a hotel in Phoenix decades before Arizona won its statehood, also claimed to own the city's first bathtub.\nBoth attended the groundbreaking of this tower, though Georg did not make it to the opening. Their youngest son, George Jr., ran the tower and the 10-story Luhrs Building, which had a private men’s club on its top four floors. At one time the complex also housed both the state Prohibition headquarters and a front company for mafia-controlled bookmakers. The latter operation was run by mobster Gus Greenbaum, who would go on to manage two Las Vegas hotels before getting whacked along with his wife in their Phoenix home in 1958.\nHenry Trost of El Paso designed both highrises for the Luhrs family, but the architect's second effort is far more original and modern in appearance. It turned out so well that Trost successfully proposed a near duplicate, with slightly altered ornamentation and an extra floor, for a banker back in El Paso months after work began on this structure.",

Benedum and Trees had come from humble origins to strike it rich as oil wildcatters, uncorking a reservoir of black gold with the first well they drilled in 1896 in West Virginia, as well as the next 10 wells after that.\nAs for Machesney, she went on to direct her energies as an organizer and fundraiser in a major political struggle of the day: women's suffrage.

But since 1962, a modern skyscraper erected between them has broken up the ensemble.\nTraffic flows through the base and up ramps to wrap around the train station, but that's not the only thing moving under the former offices of Cornelius Vanderbilt's New York Central Railroad. The highrise and the buildings and streets surrounding it are all perched atop a double-decker underground rail yard serving Grand Central.\nThe massive project known as Terminal City was based — literally and figuratively — on \"air rights,\" meaning after the railroad covered its tracks, it could lease or sell property above them.  Lucrative income from such reclaimed real estate kept the railroad solvent for decades after the collapse of passenger train travel.\nIn a scene from \"The Godfather,\" the five families meet in the railroad's boardroom, an appropriate location considering a squad of hitmen gunned down a mafia boss in his office here in 1931. Real estate tycoon Harry Helmsley bought the building after the railroad's departure, stamped his name on it, and slathered the exterior sculptures in gold leaf. Much of that has been removed, but the restored lobby remains wondrously luxurious.",

        "description": "The last great American architect before the era of steel-framed skyscrapers considered this courthouse and jail to be among his masterpieces. Kidney disease took Henry H. Richardson before he could see this granite hulk completed, but this structure helped to extend the popularity of the Boston architect's rough-hewn \"Richardsonian Romanesque\" style until it was swept away by newfangled highrises.\nRichardson first won widespread acclaim for his Trinity Church in Boston, which was completed in 1877. This courthouse, which replaced one that had burned down, is capped with a soaring central tower which — though it looks like a belfry and plays recorded carillon chimes every day — has never contained a bell. Its purpose is ventilation, with an air intake fan in each of the four turrets clustered at the top designed to draw in air free of Pittsburgh's legendary smoke.\nThe tower was intended as a monumental centerpiece for the city's evolving skyline, but it enjoyed that status for hardly more than a decade. Henry Clay Frick, a former partner of Andrew Carnegie who became the steel baron's archenemy, built an equally tall skyscraper directly across the street from the courthouse. His reason: Carnegie had a highrise next door, and Frick wanted to block out the sun from it. ",

        "description": "The clock tower of the oldest railroad passenger terminal still in use on the West Coast has stood for more than a century as a Portland landmark. Locals can thank Henry Villard, a meteoric magnate who saved the tower from a nervous boardroom that wanted it stricken from the blueprints to save money.\nVillard, a journalist who became a representative for railroad investors back in his native Germany, was besotted by Portland's potential. Backers helped him take over a small railroad there as well as a Columbia River steamship company; the first commercial use of Thomas Edison's light bulbs was on a boat in Villard's fleet.\nAs Portland vied with Tacoma and Seattle to be the main terminus of the Northern Pacific, Villard pooled investors to seize control of that railroad. Spending sprees led to financial problems that saw him bounced from the top job and ended plans for a far more grandiose train station. But Villard used his boardroom influence to keep the centerpiece clock tower on a redesigned depot, though he never made it back to Portland to see the structure he championed.\nNeon signs tacked onto the tower in 1948 display the station's name and an exhortation to \"Go by train.\"",

        "description": "When this radio station was dedicated, President Herbert Hoover called it a \"unique temple to the modern art\" during a nationwide CBS broadcast. Vivacious ornamentation patterns in steel and brass enliven the windowless walls of its upstairs soundproof studios.\nWCAU owners Ike and Leon Levy, a lawyer and a dentist, also bought the struggling network with which their station was affiliated. Backed by a phonograph company that paid for naming rights, the Levy brothers redubbed it Columbia Broadcasting System and hired Bill Paley, Leon's brother-in-law, as its president. The son of a cigar maker, Paley saw his family's stogies sell like hotcakes after advertising on WCAU, and left the business at age 26 to run the network.\nPaley and CBS snapped up stars such as Jack Benny and Bing Crosby, earning the nickname \"Tiffany network.\" Philadelphia maestro Leopold Stokowski — the conductor in Disney's \"Fantasia\" — had an audio lab in this building and a studio where he led his orchestra in on-air performances.\nThe tall glass central tower, which was truncated in the 1970s, housed a spare transmission antenna in case the main one failed. The facade was once embedded with sparkling blue glass chips; they were later buried under a stucco surface that has been painted blue in homage to the original.",

That man-made waterway helped upstate New York to become a major industrial corridor, its factories insatiable in their demand for energy.\nCreated by a merger of three utilities in 1929, Niagara Hudson Power was headed by the president of the biggest one, Paul Schoellkopf, whose grandfather had built a hydroelectric plant at Niagara Falls three decades earlier. The new corporate headquarters of the world's largest generator and seller of electrical power had plenty of offices, plus appliance showrooms and a demonstration kitchen where customers could try out the company’s electric and gas ranges. \nBut the building's most noteworthy feature was on the outside, where spotlights, backlit panels of colored glass, and more than half a mile of neon and helium tubes shone brightly each night. The company was reorganized in 1950 as Niagara Mohawk, and in 2000 it was acquired by British power supplier National Grid. The lobby is well preserved, and the dramatic exterior lighting, most of which was removed during World War II, has been fully restored.",
