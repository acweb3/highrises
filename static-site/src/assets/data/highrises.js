            'Planned as the world’s tallest building when construction commenced in 1871, the tower was usurped by the Washington Monument and Eiffel Tower before its completion. Alexander Milne Calder’s 37-foot bronze William Penn is the tallest statue on any building anywhere, double the size of the Statue of Freedom on the U.S. Capitol.\nThat dome’s designer, Thomas Walker, came out of retirement to help architect John McArthur Jr. with this monumental edifice. Neither man lived to see their work completed. Calder, who crafted 250 sculptures for city hall and was there in 1894 to see his 27-ton Penn hoisted to its apex, despaired that the founder was installed looking north, which leaves his face perpetually in shadow.\nThe tower is built of load-bearing brick walls sheathed in marble and rests on 22-foot-thick granite walls at its base. Above the four clocks, marble gives way to white painted steel, a replacement of the original cast iron.\nBesides the internal clockwork and two extravagant mayoral and council rooms, the tower is basically empty but for a staircase and small, slow elevator to take passengers to the viewing deck. An unwritten agreement that kept Penn’s hat the tallest point in the city was finally broken in 1987.',

            'As the name implies, this tower provided offices for architects. It also was designed by them, as 20 firms participated in a committee headed by John Hall Rankin, respected dean of the field and former president of the local chapter of the American Institute of Architects.\nShortly after the building opened, the AIA held a public exhibition showcasing the work of several members who now occupied offices upstairs. Paul Cret, for instance, displayed photos of his Rodin Museum on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, recently dedicated and containing one of the most extensive collections of the Paris sculptor’s work. The AIA relocated in 2008, but its library on the top floor has been preserved as it once appeared.\nThe building, now the Hotel Palomar, has a sleek Art Deco exterior with handsome bronze panels and patterned brickwork testifying that the architects knew what they were doing. Best of all is the historic second floor elevator lobby, which combines vibrant tilework and carved wood with a dramatically coffered plaster ceiling and Welsh quarry tile floor.',

The 17-ton Founder’s Bell, commissioned in memory of John Wanamaker, first rang on New Year’s Day 1927 from a special tower constructed on the roof of the great department store.\nIt was soon relocated to the belfry of the new Lincoln-Liberty Building, the first seven floors of which purveyed a tasteful array of tailored suits, fashionable overcoats, hunting costumes and sporting goods for the discerning gentleman, with high-end leasable office space and a penthouse above. A pair of much-admired 1890s skyscrapers had to be torn down to make way for the new construction, so its original appellation name-checked them both in order to assuage any hard feelings.\nAfter Philadelphia National Bank bought the tower, four sets of its illuminated initials “PNB” perched atop the belfry for nearly 60 years. They were finally removed by cargo helicopter in 2014 from the building now known as One South Broad, and one huge “B” was rehung in the lobby.',

With 300 apartments and a cluster of penthouses, the Drake touted true high society city living.\nIn the 1970s, owners Stanton and Robert Miller ran high stakes bingo games in the ballroom five nights a week — allegedly for charity, in reality for their pockets. Unlike Sir Francis Drake, the Millers wound up sentenced to prison for their ill-gotten gains, and the property suffered through bankruptcy and other ignominies until its eventual renovation.\nThe two-story penthouse on top affords breathtaking views from its twin patios, but not from the red-roofed dome, which just hides a water tank.',

            'Said to be the world’s largest newspaper plant at the time of its construction, the Elverson Building was named for the Philadelphia Inquirer’s fourth owner, James Elverson — according to its fifth owner, his son James Elverson Jr., who commissioned it.\nIt was built over the tracks of the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad so that the huge rolls of newsprint feeding the presses could be delivered directly by train. The paper needed 800 tons of it per week; storage rooms held 200 railcars worth.\nElverson and his wife, Eleanore, a former actress, lived in apartments upstairs until he died of a heart attack in 1929 while planning festivities for the paper’s 100th anniversary. The tower’s four 16-foot clocks are accompanied by Westminster chimes; Elverson loved clocks and kept a collection of rare timepieces.\nThe Inquirer won 17 Pulitzers in its heyday from 1975 to 1990 before departing the premises in 2012. Plans to make the building into a casino were abandoned, and instead the granite and ivory terracotta highrise has been repurposed as police headquarters.',

            'Stephen Girard was one of the richest banking tycoons in American history, so the Philadelphian’s name held a natural appeal for financial institutions. The Girard Life Insurance, Annuity and Trust Company, formed five years after its namesake’s death, erected one of the city’s first highrises on the northeast corner of Broad and Chestnut.\nIn 1908, the truncated Girard Trust fittingly relocated to shorter headquarters — a two-story domed marble temple they built across the street. Eventually outgrowing that, they brought in the country’s preeminent architectural firm to design this tower, a marble-sheathed Neoclassical extension of their pantheon replica. A third skyscraper built next door in 1973, initially called Three Girard and later One Meridian Plaza, had to be demolished after it was gutted by a fire that also shut down the older highrise.\nIn 2000, the two marble Girard buildings reopened as a Ritz-Carlton, the city’s third. The first one still stands two blocks south on Broad Street; its owner built it out of spite when his wife was reprimanded for lighting a cigarette in the Bellevue-Stratford.',

Today’s grandiose dining room, with its 24-foot-high painted beam ceilings and square columns of red marble, was originally made for a bank.\nFounded by private financier Jay Cooke, the First National Bank of Philadelphia, as its name attests, was literally the first financial institution in the country chartered to print banknotes backed by the U.S. Treasury. Cooke was a private financier who loaned Pennsylvania $3 million to fund its Civil War efforts. He successfully lobbied President Abraham Lincoln and Congress to replace the country’s chaotic hodgepodge of state-run banks, establishing the banking system that exists to this day.\nLivingston Jones, First National president when this office opened, and his wife, Edith, were outdoorsy types who enjoyed canoe trips in Canada. Their daughter Cornelia became a Chestnut Hill sensation, becoming a pilot at 17 and competing in air races and shows.',

In 1960 the Penthouse restaurant and cocktail lounge opened on the top floor, offering patrons spectacular city views with their nightcaps.\nLewis Tower was purchased in 2004 for conversion into condominiums, but things got complicated the following year, when a piece of stone veneer broke off and crashed through the roof of the restaurant next door, prompting city officials to close the building.

Mitten took the top floor for his management business and leased 12 floors for the transit company, putting bus waiting rooms and ticket offices on the ground floor along with his bank and securities company, which then acquired the property and renamed it the Mitten Building. Two years later, the city sued Mitten for alleged financial scams, and soon afterward his drowned body was discovered in a fishing pond on his Poconos estate.\nA theater next door on Broad Street had its main lobby in the Equitable Building; its marquee still hangs over the Locust Street sidewalk, though the theater is now a parking garage and the lobby is a restaurant.',

            'With his city in the midst of a highrise boom, James Willcox, president of the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society, felt his institution’s planned new office tower had to make a statement to attract new tenants. Thus America got its first International Style skyscraper, a cubist masterpiece of polished granite, limestone, glass, and brick.\nInside and out, it emphasizes what architect George Howe called “the beautiful surfaces of machine production,” relying on simple geometric forms and lines for its appeal. Escalators brought customers to the banking hall on the second floor, a vast open space where ranks of boxy marble columns rise 30 feet to the ceiling and support the building above.\nThis was one of the first fully air conditioned office towers, and its trademark rooftop sign hides the cooling machinery. The TV tower is not original, added in 1948.\nFurniture and fixtures were custom designed by the architects to complement their bold design, and main interior spaces have been meticulously preserved. The building is now a hotel, and guests seeking out the former boardroom on the 33rd floor can enjoy a sweeping panorama from Fairmount Park to the Delaware River.',

            'The finery of a Loire Valley château was draped over a steel frame to create this early Philadelphia highrise. It was erected for the American Baptist Publication Society, which for years had printed and sold religious tracts and Bibles at its offices here, maintained a library, and coordinated various charitable causes until an 1896 fire destroyed it all.\nThe new building’s French style obviously curtsies to Philadelphia City Hall, while its name honors the society’s former president, John Crozer, a wealthy textile manufacturer and dedicated philanthropist. The building opened in time for Christmas in 1897, and visitors marveled at its finely appointed bookstore with oak cabinetry, cushioned settees for browsing, and a dainty reading room for women. \nThe lecture hall upstairs seated 600 guests, with high ceilings painted in allegorical frescoes. The exterior has suffered a bit since then, losing its original street-level façade and a sumptuous balcony railing that once stretched just below the steep mansard roof. But it still provides elegant quarters for the aspiring electricians who study at the charter trade school now located here.',

Now an appealing modern hotel lobby, it still preserves Liberty Title & Trust’s original marble tiled floors, elaborate crown molding and wall medallions, and a bronze elevator that accessed the old safety deposit boxes, which are now stacked on a giant bookcase for atmosphere.\nArchitect Frederic Hirons liked to blend old and new motifs too, both here and in his Beaux-Arts Institute of Design in Manhattan, which opened shortly after this building did. In digging the foundations, builders discovered a buried creek feeding the Schuylkill River. They spent months pumping out millions of gallons of water to stabilize the soggy soil; appropriately, years later, the highrise housed the city water department. \nThis was the only building on the block spared when the convention center expanded to Broad Street. That was because the authority intended to put their headquarters here, but as costs ballooned, officials had to abandon their plan.',

On New Year’s Eve 1927, Thomas Edison himself sent a telegraph message to this new office tower named in his honor and owned by Philadelphia Electric Company.\nOn the elderly inventor’s signal, keyed from his home in Menlo Park, 483 floodlights flicked on to bathe the upper floors of the Edison in a rainbow of nighttime illumination. Behind the new skyscraper on Sansom Street was a six-story coal-fired electrical station Edison’s company had built in 1888, before mergers consolidated the city’s power businesses.\nArchitect John T. Windrim designed several power plants, including an immense Beaux-Arts station on the Delaware River in Chester, and went on to design the Lincoln-Liberty Building. His bold diamond patterns in the ground-level brickwork subtly repeat near the top. They are eclipsed, however, by the building’s latest light display, an illuminated sign for Thomas Jefferson University, which acquired the property in 1973.\nThe smokestack rises from a power plant next door that stands on the footprint of Edison’s original generating station.',

            'When John Bowman became chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh in 1921, he proposed a bold plan for his growing institution: a college skyscraper. Philadelphia architect Charles Klauder, renowned for his campus buildings at Princeton and Cornell, designed the tower as a blend of Art Deco and his signature Collegiate Gothic style.\nGround was broken in 1926, and the first classes were held in the building in 1931, though the Great Depression delayed completion of the dramatic four-story Commons Room for six more years. The 40-story limestone highrise was the tallest educational building in the world until Moscow State University surpassed it in 1953.\nAt the time of construction, surveys showed that one of every three Pitt students was the child of an immigrant. To honor that heritage, the university invited Pittsburgh’s various ethnic organizations to design and fund 18 Nationality Rooms representing the mother countries. Students taking classes in the rooms, which now number 31, quickly learn to expect occasional interruptions by curious visitors peeking in the doorways.',

            'Heinrich Koppers of Germany developed an efficient industrial oven for producing coke, the essential fuel for iron and steel furnaces, while also capturing gas and tar byproducts for other uses. That interested U.S. Steel, so Koppers formed a Chicago company in 1907 to supply the American steel industry.\nFinancier Andrew Mellon soon acquired a controlling stake and moved the company to Pittsburgh. During World War I, he forced the German founder out entirely, and soon thereafter became Secretary of the Treasury.\nGraham, Anderson, Probst & White designed the company’s Art Deco headquarters with a polished granite and limestone exterior and a chateau-style roof made of – what else – copper. It was briefly the city’s tallest skyscraper until overshadowed by the Gulf Building across the street, the headquarters of another company in the Mellon portfolio.\nKoppers grew into a sprawling industrial conglomerate until a 1988 British hostile takeover led to the sale of several divisions. Managers bought the chemicals business, which is still based in the skyscraper. The building’s three-story marble lobby with bronze accents has been extensively restored.',

Its signature flourish, a cast concrete baroque dome, was inspired by an even more elaborate dome capping the headquarters of the San Francisco Call.\nThe Keenan dome was originally gold, not red, and was crowned by a large globe and eagle. First to move in under the golden dome was a photography studio, then for decades the uppermost stories housed a school for women.\nKeenan crusaded against civic corruption and vice; that, along with his bachelor status, may explain false rumors that he lived in a penthouse under the dome and used it for trysts. Today the space is a community room for residents of what is now called Midtown Towers. It has been extensively remodeled after a 2017 fire.\nTen bas-reliefs at sidewalk level honor important public figures including city namesake William Pitt, philanthropist Mary Schenley, and H.D.W. English, president of the chamber of commerce, which moved its offices here when the building opened.',

But the dozen letters spelling Bromo-Seltzer that replace traditional numerals on the clocks indicate how far Isaac Emerson was willing to go to flog his product.\nThe former drugstore proprietor invented a fizzy elixir to treat headaches and indigestion, and encouraged its widespread adoption by other druggists through offers of company stock in exchange for high sales volume. The powder was packaged in attractive blue glass bottles, samples of which are displayed in a quaint museum on the top floor.\nEmerson’s factory is gone, but the tower it was attached to was given to the city when the drug company left town. Too skinny for offices — two-thirds of each floor is used up by the elevator, stairs, and landing — it has been converted into loft space for artists.',

Its interior is equally breathtaking, with multicolored marble columns supporting the painted beamed ceiling and four large murals depicting the city in each century of its existence.\nAlas, the lovely hand-wrought iron gates by master blacksmith Samuel Yellin now bar the public from the former banking hall, which has been repurposed as a gym. Its spectacular mosaic floor by the acclaimed muralist Hildreth Meière — creator of Radio City Music Hall’s signature sculptures — is covered with mats to protect it.\nOnce the state’s biggest financial institution, Baltimore Trust did not survive the 1933 banking panic. Now a residential highrise, the building has changed hands and names repeatedly. Its most colorful owner, West Virginia millionaire and political gadfly Raymond J. Funkhouser, renamed it the O’Sullivan building in 1942 after a company he owned that made rubber shoe heels. He also kicked an upscale barbershop out of the top floor so he could put his penthouse there.',

            'Ever since its unveiling, “Wings of Progress,” the bold 42-foot aluminum sculpture capping this bank highrise, has tempted residents of Rochester to speculate on its meaning. Some say it represents maple seedpods or bat wings, others say a screwdriver or an arrowhead shattered by the city’s brutal winters.\nArchitect Ralph Walker, who helped to establish the canon for Art Deco skyscrapers with his Barclay-Vesey and Irving Trust buildings in Manhattan, said he wanted to convey a sense of flight and was inspired by seashells he found on the beach in Florida. Hailed by the American Institute of Architects in 1957 as “architect of the century,” Walker later resigned from the organization over an ethics controversy. He committed suicide at the age of 83, rumor has it with a silver bullet he forged for himself.\nThe bank moved out after a 1955 merger, and the new owner redubbed this the Times Square Building after the former name of the intersection where it stands. A dramatic red marble lobby still features the original chandelier. Stylized bas-reliefs over the front windows by New York sculptor Leo Friedlander depict two Greek goddesses representing security and trust.',

            'The city council of Buffalo made the best decision in its history in 1926 when it rejected its municipal architect’s uninspiring plan for a new civic building. Instead they turned to John Wade, an opinionated local designer who produced one of the most spectacular Art Deco highrises ever constructed.\nThe elegantly stepped sandstone mass features stylized carvings and polychromatic terracotta in geometric Native American motifs. A frieze over the entrance depicts the city writing her future, surrounded by stevedores, ironworkers, and research chemists; the rear frieze showcases key historic episodes. In the lobby are vivid, almost comic book murals of musclebound men and gleaming women by William de Leftwich Dodge, whose work also decorates the Library of Congress and the New York State Capitol.\nBuffalo’s councilmen could not agree on which citizens to honor in their 13th floor chambers. So instead, identical busts represent various virtues, lit by a large stained glass skylight of the rising sun.Visitors to the free observatory on the top floor can take in the sprawling cityscape, Lake Erie, and distant Niagara Falls.\nA park in front has an obelisk to President William McKinley, assassinated in Buffalo in 1901. Bronze statues of the two presidents who hailed from the city, Millard Fillmore and Grover Cleveland, are the site’s sole concession to mediocrity.',

But searchlights and red neon made the spire a helpful beacon for airplanes in the days before radar, and it still blinks at night today.\nIt is a sobering tribute to the building’s namesake, George Rand Sr., who died in a plane crash in England in 1919. Rand was president of Marine Trust, one of the state’s largest banks. He was returning from Paris, where Rand had offered the French prime minister a large private sum to fund a new war memorial.\nGeorge Rand Jr. soon succeeded his father and oversaw planning of this new headquarters for the bank, which was the city’s tallest skyscraper for more than 40 years. The 18th floor housed the studios of radio station WGR, whose call letters also commemorate George Rand.\nThis was the sole skyscraper designed by Franklyn and William Kidd, who immigrated with their parents from Scotland. Franklyn designed a mansion for the Rands in 1918, which helped him to land this commission.',

They were designed by Italian immigrant sculptor Leo Lentelli, who had gazed upon the much larger original when he sailed into New York harbor.\nThe financial institution that erected this skyscraper was founded in 1882 for immigrants as the German American Bank. America’s entry into World War I prompted a name change in 1918 which, besides being patriotic, was a shrewd marketing scheme. The U.S. government was heavily promoting war bonds, and the renamed institution took out ads urging: “Buy your Liberty Bonds at the Liberty Bank.”\nArchitect Alfred Bossom was an immigrant too. After a career in New York designing skyscrapers, he returned to England, served in Parliament for 28 years, and became a mentor to Margaret Thatcher, the future prime minister.\nThe lobby has extraordinary coffered ceilings and a carved marble version of the rooftop statues in a niche behind the security desk. The statues are modeled on the bank logo, a modernized version of Lady Liberty with short hair and an athletic build.',

Unfortunately, that optimism proved to be unwarranted. Buffalo’s urban core failed to expand here, and even if it had, the age of the automobile spelled the end of passenger rail.\nThe facility was designed to handle 200 trains and 10,000 people daily, with an attached office skyscraper whose lobby also served as the main entrance to the station. Alfred Fellheimer was a railway terminal expert and the lead architect of Grand Central Station in New York; his firm also designed Cincinnati’s train station, considered an Art Deco masterpiece, at roughly the same time as this one.\nThe last train chugged out Buffalo station in 1979, and weeds now grow over its disused platforms. The property badly deteriorated under subsequent owners, a victim of weather, vandalism, and arson. Preservationists bought it in 1997 for one dollar plus back taxes. They restored the tower clocks and the main concourse, and recently released a master plan for renovating the rest of the abandoned complex.',

            'To celebrate its pioneering power grid supplied by turbines at Niagara Falls, Buffalo erected a temporary 391-foot Electric Tower at its 1901 World’s Fair. Buffalo General Electric supplied current to light the hundreds of bulbs that festooned it, and a decade later the company commissioned a smaller version of the tower for its own offices.\nThis was designed by local architects August Esenwein and James Johnson, who had done several buildings for the fair, though not the original tower. In addition to offices, the new building had a product showroom and a transformer station in the basement. At the summit was an auditorium for company meetings and a public observation deck and searchlights that could be seen more than 50 miles away.\nA few elements of the exterior have been lost over the years, such as a sculpture of two youths admiring a dynamo. The tower housed power company offices for most of its existence, much of it under the name of parent corporation Niagara Mohawk after a 1950 consolidation. It was sold to an independent developer in 2004, and the lobby has been substantially restored from earlier remodeling.',

            '“Harmony without dullness” is how architect Henry Churchill summarized this office highrise, still the tallest building in central New York. Besides its bold terracotta accent panels, the bricks get lighter the higher they go, adding an illusion of sunlight even on gloomy days. Inside, the elevator lobby is a controlled riot of geometric designs.\nBuilt for New York developer Albert Meyer, the tower was the fruit of a creative if short-lived partnership between Churchill and Stuart Thompson. In their home base of Manhattan, their Lowell Hotel still has a lush pink tiled entrance, and their Bauhaus-style glass box loft was one of very few American buildings included in the 1932 Museum of Modern Art exhibition that defined the International Style.\nThe skyscraper stands on the site of a prior office block destroyed in a 1923 fire that killed three people and triggered a new city requirement for sprinklers. A 1962 gas explosion was strong enough to buckle the State Tower Building’s basement walls, but fortunately caused only a few injuries. The property has undergone recent renovations and now has apartments in its upper floors.',

He ultimately became partner, was lead designer of the nearby 1906 Beaux-Arts county courthouse, and went on to create a gleaming Art Deco tour-de-force five blocks away, the Niagara Hudson Building. King eventually turned the business over to his son and nephew; King & King is now New York’s oldest continuously operating architectural firm.\nCarved ornamental columns in the Hills Building’s granite base attractively frame its entrance arch.

            'Chartered in 1849, the Syracuse Savings Bank was the first bank to open in a city that was then only a year old. By 1874 the institution needed new headquarters and announced a design competition. The winning entry came from Joseph Silsbee, a recent graduate of the nation’s first school of architecture at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nVisitors thrilled to ride in the city’s first elevator for views from the top of the tower, where Silsbee put his office. He helped to establish Syracuse University’s architecture department, prospered with more commissions, and eventually relocated to Chicago. But this steep-gabled sandstone edifice is still considered Silbee’s masterpiece, a textbook example of High Victorian Gothic. Preservationists in the 1960s made it a centerpiece in their fight against unbridled urban redevelopment. \nThe bank once stood over the Erie Canal, which ran through downtown Syracuse until it was filled in during the 1920s to become Erie Avenue. The impressive banking room is still in use and has the original beamed ceilings and extensive gothic trimmings. The main block’s top three floors were recently remodeled into luxury apartments. A carillon once chimed in the tower but has been silent for decades.',

The designer quit when his independent post of state architect was subsumed under the public works department.\nBut its champion, Al Smith, four-term governor of New York, pressed relentlessly for a tower to house Albany’s scattered state workforce. Smith oversaw planning and even manned the steam shovel at the groundbreaking. Then, with construction underway, he ran for president against Herbert Hoover and lost in a landslide.\nHis gubernatorial successor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, won the White House four years later. Smith exited politics to head the corporation that raised the Empire State Building. Months after his death in 1945, legislators renamed the state office tower in Smith’s honor. Today it stands above the State Capitol and Empire State Plaza like an Art Deco transition from the Gilded Age to the Space Age.\nThe lobby ceiling is painted with murals of important New Yorkers, and all 62 counties have their names carved into the facade. Ten important ones get a big font treatment — but not the neglected Bronx, small and nearly hidden on the side of the entrance.',

            'Most of this building is actually an addition. The left side was the original 10-story skyscraper, designed by Marcus Reynolds, a prominent and well-connected local architect. Two decades later in 1922, the bank brought back Reynolds for a major expansion project that added six more window bays and the central clock tower, plus a large addition in the rear.\nReynolds, who designed numerous Albany landmarks including the castle-like Delaware and Hudson Building and the domed Albany Trust Building, had his offices in this highrise. So did the Thachers, an industrial and political dynasty who ran the bank and a railcar wheel works and could boast of three members elected mayor of the city between 1860 and 1940.\nThe main hall in the middle, once used for banking, is now used for banqueting. Marble pillars with gilded capitals soar above the potted palms, supporting a dramatic vaulted ceiling. The original side has a metallic coffered ceiling and a bronze arched doorway leading into the event space. Passersby are likely unaware that one pair of winged lions leering down at them from above is considerably younger than the pair a few steps up the sidewalk.',

Between and below them are stylized flowers and other decorations in deep blue, yellow, and ocher.\nThe panels are by Rene Chambellan, a leading Art Deco architectural sculptor. His work also embellishes the State Office Tower in town, as well as more famous skyscrapers including the American Radiator Building in Manhattan, Tribune Tower in Chicago, and Buffalo City Hall. The spiraling foliage motif repeats in carvings below on the granite base of the structure and on the ceiling inside the former banking hall, now used for wedding receptions and galas.\nThe financial institution that paid for this highrise boasted in ads that it was “Albany’s most beautiful savings bank.” An elegant scroll and wreath in low relief on the facade below the bank’s carved name commemorates its founding in 1871. Beneath that are additional profiles of the original residents of the region, interspersed with their noisy new neighbors.',

            'This former railroad terminal was inspired by the Cloth Hall in Ypres, a Flemish Gothic landmark badly damaged in World War I just as this homage was being constructed in Albany. Delaware and Hudson, which began as a canal bringing barges from the Scranton coalfields to New York, was one of six rail lines serving the state capital. Its new offices were devised to block the view from State Street of unsightly railyards and steamer docks at the riverfront.\nA more romantic explanation is sometimes proffered: that the building marks the spot where Henry Hudson forlornly came ashore in his failed search for a fabled Northwest Passage to the Pacific Ocean. His ship, Half Moon, spins on the rooftop weathervane.\nThe State University of New York purchased the complex in 1972 to convert into the main administration offices for its more than 60 campuses. Arcaded main hallways with vaulted tile ceilings are the last original interiors. Luxurious former apartments of a newspaper publisher and political boss at the south end of the complex used to be offered to SUNY chancellors, but they have been converted into office space.',

That was surely deliberate: Paul Gmelin, the German-born architect who drew it up, worked for a New York firm founded by the son of Leopold Eidlitz, one of the architects who worked on the capitol.\nAlbany was an early adopter of telecommunications technology. One year after Alexander Graham Bell won the gold medal for his invention at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, the city became the first to get phones for its police department, hooking up a set for the chief with one at each precinct house and another for the mayor.\nDemand only grew, eventually requiring this local administrative headquarters and exchange for New York Telephone. A decade later, the architect was called back to expand the building the full length of the block. It doubled in size again in the 1960s, this time with a modern appearance meant to blend with its new neighbor, Empire State Plaza. It remains a telephone administrative office building to this day.',

            'The 1920s design revolution known as Art Deco took some interesting turns, including a brief fascination with Mayan motifs such as the painted friezes on this highrise. Buffalo architect James Johnson intended them to offset the stark verticality of what was the tallest skyscraper on the American side of Niagara Falls for almost 80 years.\nIt was constructed as the main headquarters of United Hotels, a luxury chain created by lawyer and entrepreneur Frank Dudley. Dudley helped to form several local ventures including a trolley company, an electric utility, and the city’s first country club. He also developed the city’s upscale Lewiston Heights neighborhood, where James designed a mansion for Dudley and his wife, Harriet.\nUnited was one of the era’s biggest hotel chains, with properties in the United States, Canada, and overseas. A flagship was the Niagara Hotel across the street, which has been vacant for several years. So was this highrise until it was renovated and reopened as a boutique hotel and apartment complex. The top story is now an observation room where guests can watch the river hurl itself over the escarpment to become the American Falls.',
