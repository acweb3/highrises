    "description": "Market Street National Bank was designed by Philadelphia architects Ritter and Shay in 1931. The Art Deco style is most noticeable in the multicolored decoration on the street-level facade and the terra cotta details in the upper stories. The stepped nature of the upper stories is a result of municipal laws that require access to light and air, but the resulting form is actually quite complementary to the Art Deco manner. Although the tower is considered to be Art Deco, it also has some unmistakable Beaux-Arts influences seen in the volutes, swags and garlands. Some of these details interpret classical forms and others are more geometric, abstract, and modern. The design is a unique moment when classical details are evolving into modern characteristics all in one building. In 2001 it was converted into a Residence Inn by Marriott. The sign “Market Street National Bank” and the original multicolored details, continue to be on the face of the entrance to this day.Book Text:Market Street National Bank was designed by Philadelphia architects Ritter and Shay in 1931.
