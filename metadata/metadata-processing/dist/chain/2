    "description": "As the name implies, this tower provided offices for architects. It also was designed by them, as 20 firms participated in a committee headed by John Hall Rankin, respected dean of the field and former president of the local chapter of the American Institute of Architects.\nShortly after the building opened, the AIA held a public exhibition showcasing the work of several members who now occupied offices upstairs. Paul Cret, for instance, displayed photos of his Rodin Museum on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, recently dedicated and containing one of the most extensive collections of the Paris sculptorâ€™s work. The AIA relocated in 2008, but its library on the top floor has been preserved as it once appeared.\nThe building, now the Hotel Palomar, has a sleek Art Deco exterior with handsome bronze panels and patterned brickwork testifying that the architects knew what they were doing. Best of all is the historic second floor elevator lobby, which combines vibrant tilework and carved wood with a dramatically coffered plaster ceiling and Welsh quarry tile floor.",
