    "description": "Before the tower was born, the parent building was built in 1908 and designed to be a replica of the Pantheon in Rome. It was built for The Girard Trust Company, and the bank’s history was intentionally incorporated into the design palette of the hotel, including 9,000 tons of Georgia marble and rich colors resembling precious metals and currency. The adjoining tower was designed by McKim, Mead and White in 1931, and built to house The Girard Trust bank offices and boardrooms. It was originally supposed to be eight stories, but ended up reaching thirty. On the top floor was the Executive Boardroom of Girard Trust, and similar to the base building, it is furnished with expensive materials including carved wood paneling made from French walnut, a species that is now extinct. In 2000, The Girard Trust Building was converted into a 330 room Ritz-Carlton hotel, and it continues to shine in luxury and wealth today.Personality:Rich spoiled kidInseparable with his very rich fatherEndowed Book Text:Before the tower was born, the parent building was built in 1908 and designed to be a replica of the Pantheon in Rome.
