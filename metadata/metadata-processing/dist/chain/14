    "description": "Ever since Ben Franklin flew his famous kite, electricity has played a key role in the City of Brotherly Love. On New Year’s Eve 1927, Thomas Edison himself sent a telegraph message to this new office tower named in his honor and owned by Philadelphia Electric Company.\nOn the elderly inventor’s signal, keyed from his home in Menlo Park, 483 floodlights flicked on to bathe the upper floors of the Edison in a rainbow of nighttime illumination. Behind the new skyscraper on Sansom Street was a six-story coal-fired electrical station Edison’s company had built in 1888, before mergers consolidated the city’s power businesses.\nArchitect John T. Windrim designed several power plants, including an immense Beaux-Arts station on the Delaware River in Chester, and went on to design the Lincoln-Liberty Building. His bold diamond patterns in the ground-level brickwork subtly repeat near the top. They are eclipsed, however, by the building’s latest light display, an illuminated sign for Thomas Jefferson University, which acquired the property in 1973.\nThe smokestack rises from a power plant next door that stands on the footprint of Edison’s original generating station.",
