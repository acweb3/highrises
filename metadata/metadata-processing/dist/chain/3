    "description": "While Wanamaker’s is famed for its enormous pipe organ, this granite highrise built to hold a much-expanded men’s department for the store is known for the hourly tolls of its gigantic bell. The 17-ton Founder’s Bell, commissioned in memory of John Wanamaker, first rang on New Year’s Day 1927 from a special tower constructed on the roof of the great department store.\nIt was soon relocated to the belfry of the new Lincoln-Liberty Building, the first seven floors of which purveyed a tasteful array of tailored suits, fashionable overcoats, hunting costumes and sporting goods for the discerning gentleman, with high-end leasable office space and a penthouse above. A pair of much-admired 1890s skyscrapers had to be torn down to make way for the new construction, so its original appellation name-checked them both in order to assuage any hard feelings.\nAfter Philadelphia National Bank bought the tower, four sets of its illuminated initials “PNB” perched atop the belfry for nearly 60 years. They were finally removed by cargo helicopter in 2014 from the building now known as One South Broad, and one huge “B” was rehung in the lobby.",
