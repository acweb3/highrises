    "description": "Built in 1924, the 21 story highrise was originally the headquarters for the bank Liberty Title and Trust Company. The tower was designed by Savery &amp; Sheetz with visible late Beaux-Arts training and emerging Art Deco inspirations. The east wall was left without details with the expectation that this face would be obscured by a neighboring building. Over the next few decades Liberty Title and Trust Building housed various owners. The last owner to vacate the building in 1990â€™s was the Philadelphia Water Department. In 2008, plans to convert the Liberty Title Building into a hotel were stalled for a couple of years due to the recession. When the Pennsylvania Convention Center started construction in 2011, The Liberty Title and Trust Building was the only existing building on the block to survive the expansion. Renovations were finally completed in 2016 and today it is an Aloft Hotel that is highly praised for its seamless blend between modern life and historic details.",
