    "description": "A rich marble staircase worn by a century of shoe leather leads from the sidewalk entrance to what was originally a brightly sunlit banking floor. Now an appealing modern hotel lobby, it still preserves Liberty Title & Trustâ€™s original marble tiled floors, elaborate crown molding and wall medallions, and a bronze elevator that accessed the old safety deposit boxes, which are now stacked on a giant bookcase for atmosphere.\nArchitect Frederic Hirons liked to blend old and new motifs too, both here and in his Beaux-Arts Institute of Design in Manhattan, which opened shortly after this building did. In digging the foundations, builders discovered a buried creek feeding the Schuylkill River. They spent months pumping out millions of gallons of water to stabilize the soggy soil; appropriately, years later, the highrise housed the city water department. \nThis was the only building on the block spared when the convention center expanded to Broad Street. That was because the authority intended to put their headquarters here, but as costs ballooned, officials had to abandon their plan.",
