    "description": "The contours of this slab skyscraper are Art Deco, but slathered on top is an icing of terracotta and tiled rooftops and gazebos seemingly transplanted from Seville or Southern California. Developers named the luxury residential highrise for a celebrated English privateer who looted goodly sums of Spanish booty while claiming the Pacific coast for Queen Elizabeth I.\nArchitects Ritter & Shay also designed Market Street National Bank, a cousin to the Drake that features ornamentation more strictly Deco though no less exuberant. With 300 apartments and a cluster of penthouses, the Drake touted true high society city living.\nIn the 1970s, owners Stanton and Robert Miller ran high stakes bingo games in the ballroom five nights a week â€” allegedly for charity, in reality for their pockets. Unlike Sir Francis Drake, the Millers wound up sentenced to prison for their ill-gotten gains, and the property suffered through bankruptcy and other ignominies until its eventual renovation.\nThe two-story penthouse on top affords breathtaking views from its twin patios, but not from the red-roofed dome, which just hides a water tank.",
