    "description": "Like a bizarre lighthouse shining over the harbor, this showy brick replica of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, Italy, was once crowned with a revolving, illuminated 50-foot tall bottle of the Emerson Drug Company’s signature hangover cure.\nThat massive beacon caused cracks in the tower and had to come down in 1936. But the dozen letters spelling Bromo-Seltzer that replace traditional numerals on the clocks indicate how far Isaac Emerson was willing to go to flog his product.\nThe former drugstore proprietor invented a fizzy elixir to treat headaches and indigestion, and encouraged its widespread adoption by other druggists through offers of company stock in exchange for high sales volume. The powder was packaged in attractive blue glass bottles, samples of which are displayed in a quaint museum on the top floor.\nEmerson’s factory is gone, but the tower it was attached to was given to the city when the drug company left town. Too skinny for offices — two-thirds of each floor is used up by the elevator, stairs, and landing — it has been converted into loft space for artists.",
