    "description": "After Thomas Keenan made a fortune selling his newspaper, the Pittsburgh Press, he commissioned the first skyscraper on Liberty Avenue. Its signature flourish, a cast concrete baroque dome, was inspired by an even more elaborate dome capping the headquarters of the San Francisco Call.\nThe Keenan dome was originally gold, not red, and was crowned by a large globe and eagle. First to move in under the golden dome was a photography studio, then for decades the uppermost stories housed a school for women.\nKeenan crusaded against civic corruption and vice; that, along with his bachelor status, may explain false rumors that he lived in a penthouse under the dome and used it for trysts. Today the space is a community room for residents of what is now called Midtown Towers. It has been extensively remodeled after a 2017 fire.\nTen bas-reliefs at sidewalk level honor important public figures including city namesake William Pitt, philanthropist Mary Schenley, and H.D.W. English, president of the chamber of commerce, which moved its offices here when the building opened.",
