    "description": "The 1616 Building was an architectural marvel for the city being one of the first properties to feature on-site parking. The five-story parking garage was quite an advanced feature at the time. 1616 Walnut was built by the Pew Family, owners of the Sun Oil company who had their headquarters next door. The building was mostly office spaces, with the exception of the Pew family apartment on the 25th floor. Like many Art Deco Buildings, a lot of attention to detail was brought to the interior while having a rather subdued exterior cladding. The bronze screen entrance is detailed in zig-zag motifs, the main lobby features rare aluminum trims, and the Pew apartment is ornamented with whimsical decorative woodwork. In 2013, construction began to convert the building from office into apartments. The renovations involved full restoration of all of the original interior finishes and heavy restoration of the exterior facade, including the metal work, entrance, and installing more than 1,300 replica windows.

Its exterior details are only a glimpse of the true beauty that lies within.Completed in 1929, the 1616 building was an architectural marvel for the city and even received top honors at the 12th International Building Congress in Budapest. It was one of the first properties to feature on-site parking with a five-story parking garage that was quite an advanced feature at the time. 1616 Walnut was built by the Pew Family, owners of the Sun Oil company who had their headquarters next door. The family apartment was on the 25th floor.  Many Art Deco buildings receive more attention to lavish details on the interior, but the 1616 Building takes the cake.
