    "description": "Before the Inquirer Building, it was called the Elverson Building, after James Elverson, who was the publisher of the Inquirer from 1889-1911. James Elverson Jr. funded the construction of this building to dedicate to his father. The Beaux-Arts design tower was colloquially called “Tower of Truth”. Elverson Jr. and his wife lived in a duplex apartment on the 12th and 13th floor. In its early years, this newspaper operation was one of the most modern printing plants in the world. It had the largest composing room and the fastest printing presses. However, since the 1980’s the newspaper has gone through significant downsizing with staff buyouts, newsroom cuts, international bureau closures, and other operational cutbacks caused by declining advertising revenue. The Inquirer stood vacant for six years until 2017 when city officials announced plans to make it into the new headquarters for the Philadelphia Police Department. The city has spent $50.5 million to renovate both the interior and exterior.

But what started out as an accomplished career soon turned into a desperate need to change career paths. After an expensive makeover, this building is ready to start a new life. Before the Inquirer Building, it was called the Elverson Building, after James Elverson, who was the publisher of the Inquirer from 1889-1911. James Elverson Jr. funded the construction of this building to dedicate to his father. The $10 million project started in 1923 and the Philadelphia Inquirer officially occupied it in 1925. The Beaux-Arts design was in every detail intended to be for a newspaper operation and was colloquially called “Tower of Truth”. Elverson Jr. and his wife lived in a duplex apartment on the 12th and 13th floor. Though it was the tallest building north of City Hall at the time, it was still in a way operated like a  traditional “mom and pop” company with the owners living above the business. In its early years, this newspaper operation was one of the most modern printing plants in the world. It had the largest composing room and the fastest printing presses. However, since the 1980’s the newspaper has gone through significant downsizing with staff buyouts, newsroom cuts, international bureau closures, and other operational cutbacks caused by declining advertising revenue. The Inquirer went through several owner changes and by 2011 it was owned by Philadelphia Media Network. The newspaper operation had to move to 8th and Market, and the building was sold for around $19 million to developer Bart Blatstein. Blatstein had several ideas for how to occupy the Inquirer Building. First plan was to renovate it into a French-themed casino, and then plans changed to make it into a 125 room boutique hotel. The Inquirer instead just stood vacant for six years until 2017 when city officials announced plans to make it into the new headquarters for the Philadelphia Police Department. The city has spent $50.5 million to renovate both the interior and exterior. Renovations have been completed as of 2020, and with a hopeful future, the Inquirer Building now shines brighter than ever.",
