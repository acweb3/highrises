    "description": "This concrete and steel office highrise with its stark bright cladding was added to an existing 16-story building on 15th Street that covers its lower floors with a far more staid Neoclassical facade. Its architect, Staten Island native Arthur Hall, designed army posts across the country during World War I, then came to Philadelphia, where he drew up the plans of at least two other skyscrapers and a number of Main Line homes.\nDeveloper Richard Seltzer put a gymnasium with squash and handball courts halfway up the slender skyscraper so office tenants had a convenient place to exercise. In 1960 the Penthouse restaurant and cocktail lounge opened on the top floor, offering patrons spectacular city views with their nightcaps.\nLewis Tower was purchased in 2004 for conversion into condominiums, but things got complicated the following year, when a piece of stone veneer broke off and crashed through the roof of the restaurant next door, prompting city officials to close the building. Now fully repaired and renovated, it has been redubbed the Aria.",
