    "description": "The Lewis Tower, now known as the Aria, was built in 1929 and designed by architecture firm Edmund Gilchrist. Located in the vicinity of the Rittenhouse neighborhood, The Lewis Tower was one of Phialdelphia/s tallest office buildings until new construction started in Center City in 1980’s. The Art Deco tower’s bright brick cladding made it stand out in the skyline from similar towers that were built in that same year, like the Drake. In 2005, the office tower was sold to be converted into 114 units of condominiums, penthouses on the top three floors, and commercial space on the street level. In the Fall of 2005, a large section of stone facade fell from the 15th floor onto a neighboring building, and so the city ordained the new owners to facilitate major repairs. Exterior renovation included facade scrubbing and treatment, and additionally there were extensive interior renovations. The building was renamed to Aria because of its location just off the Avenue of the Arts.
