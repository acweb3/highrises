With his city in the midst of a highrise boom, James Willcox, president of the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society, felt his institution’s planned new office tower had to make a statement to attract new tenants. Thus America got its first International Style skyscraper, a cubist masterpiece of polished granite, limestone, glass, and brick.
Inside and out, it emphasizes what architect George Howe called “the beautiful surfaces of machine production,” relying on simple geometric forms and lines for its appeal. Escalators brought customers to the banking hall on the second floor, a vast open space where ranks of boxy marble columns rise 30 feet to the ceiling and support the building above.
This was one of the first fully air conditioned office towers, and its trademark rooftop sign hides the cooling machinery. The TV tower is not original, added in 1948.
Furniture and fixtures were custom designed by the architects to complement their bold design, and main interior spaces have been meticulously preserved. The building is now a hotel, and guests seeking out the former boardroom on the 33rd floor can enjoy a sweeping panorama from Fairmount Park to the Delaware River.
