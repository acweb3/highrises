Originally built for the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society in 1932, it was designed by William Lescaze and George Howe. PSFS Building is most known for being the first International style skyscraper in the U.S. Unlike traditional banks, it doesn’t have conventional features like domes or classical ornamentation. The tower was built for functionality, in a T-shape to allow maximum amount of natural light and rentable space. The office tower attracted many tenants for modern features like radio receivers and air conditioning. Although it was completed during the Great Depression, the iconic PSFS neon sign was always kept lit to create a symbol of hope for the city. In tough times, the city jokingly called the sign  “Philadelphia Slowly Faces Starvation”. In the 1980’s, Philadelphia Savings Fund Society started to lose millions in new business ventures. By 1992, the building was 85 percent vacant, and was sold off to be converted into a Loews Hotel. Today the building does very well, attracting visitors in town for events at the Convention Center down the block.Book Text: Originally built for the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society in 1932, it was designed by William Lescaze and George Howe.
