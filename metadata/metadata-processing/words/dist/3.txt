The Art Deco tower was commissioned by Rodman Wanamaker in 1932. The first seven floors was the Wanamaker’s Men’s Store, and the 24th and 25th floor was a luxury penthouse for Rodman Wanamaker and his wife. The bell tower housed the 15-ton Founder’s Bell. Opening during the Great Depression, the store unfortunately only lasted 20 years in the building. The Philadelphia National Bank (PNB) bought the building and converted it into banking offices in 1952. In an attempt to modernize the building, renovations removed a lot of the detailing and fluting of the original ornate lower facade, and replaced it with granite black slabs on the street level. After several owner changes, the building had been officially renamed to be One South Broad in 1996, but the famous PNB letters decorating the four sides of the bell tower weren’t removed until 2014. More renovations in 2000 converted the lower floors to retail and restaurant space. The granite black slabs added by PNB were removed and replaced with imported Italian granite to better match the original architecture. Personality:Well dressed gentlemanBankerBusiness guy in a nice suitAlso known as Lincoln-Liberty Building or PNB BuildingBook Text:One South Broad has always been in the business of money. Initially designed as a department store catering to the “Phialdleplhia Gentleman”, this building continues to resemble a well suited city bank owner.Built in 1932, the Art deco tower in Center City was commissioned by Rodman Wanamaker. The first seven floors was the Wanamaker’s Men’s Store, and on the 24th and 25th floor was a luxury penthouse for Rodman Wanamaker and his wife, although they lived there only briefly. The bell tower housed the 15-ton Founder’s Bell. The Bell was originally intended to swing, but the swinging of the bell shook the building. It’s now operated mechanically and rings hourly, except for Sundays. Despite opening during the Great Depression, the company had a lot of faith that the store would do exceptionally well, but unfortunately the store only lasted 20 years before moving to the Wanamaker building a few blocks away. The Philadelphia National Bank (PNB) bought the building for $9 million and converted it into banking offices in 1952. The now PNB building decorated the four sides of the bell tower with 16 feet tall stainless steel letters, which forecasted weather by turning letters red to indicate a warming trend, or green for cooling trend. In an attempt to modernize the building, renovations removed a lot of the detailing and fluting of the original ornate lower facade, and replaced it with granite black slabs on the street level. Over the years PNB became CoreState, First Union Corp, Wachovia and then Wells Fargo, which is now the largest tenant occupying most of the building. The building had been officially renamed to be One South Broad in 1996, but the famous PNB letters weren’t removed until 2014. More renovations in 2000 converted the lower floors to retail and restaurant space. The granite black slabs added by PNB were removed and replaced with imported Italian granite to better match the original architecture. Although no longer a department store, One South Broad in a way continues to keep the Wanamaker legacy alive by striving to portray a financially successful, well dressed, Philadelphia gentleman.
