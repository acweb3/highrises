            'Designed in the French Second Empire style, City Hall is a thick masonry construction with walls up to 22ft thick. In addition to the William Penn statue at the top, there are up to 250 relief and free-standing sculptures that convey moral allegories about the U.S. Each of the four facades carries a continental theme. The north face represents Europe, south face carries African figures, east face holds Asia, and west face supports Native Americans. Philadelphia City Hall was planned to be the tallest building in the world, but by the time it was completed in 1901, it had already been surpassed. There was a gentlemen’s agreement that no other building in Philadelphia would be taller than City Hall, which was maintained until 1986. As soon as it was complete, it was already out of fashion. City government even considered demolishing it in the 1950’s. However, the cost of demolition was equal to the cost of construction and would have bankrupted the city, so fortunately the city decided to suspend any plans for demolition. Personality:PoetOld english aristocratOld guy speaking in riddlesThe OG BoomerBook Text:Philadelphia City Hall is the elderly story-telling grandfather of the city. Although it was once considered antiquated enough to demolish, it is now one of the most beloved structures in the U.S. With no stone uncarved, this building continues to tell stories with its ornamentation for generations to come.Prior to the current City Hall, all municipal offices resided in a two-story building on Fifth and Chestnut Street. Plans to build a new City Hall started in 1838, when the city’s population doubled to 565,000 people. The architecture was intended to be a representation of the city’s aspirations. Designed in the French Second Empire style, City hall is a thick masonry construction with walls up to 22ft thick. The stonemason William Struthers and sculptor Alexander Milne Calder were responsible for casting 250 relief and free-standing sculptures that convey moral allegories about the nation and the city. Each of the four facades carries a continental theme. The north face represents Europe, south face carries African figures, east face holds Asia, and west face supports Native Americans. The statue of William Penn atop the clock tower is 37 feet tall and weighs 27 tons, and is required to be cleaned every 10 years. Philadelphia City Hall was planned to be the tallest building in the world, with the top of William Penn’s hat reaching 548 feet, but by the time it was completed in 1901, it had been surpassed by the Washington Monument and the Eiffel Tower. There was a gentlemen’s agreement that no other building in Philadelphia would be taller than City Hall, which was maintained until 1986. Nevertheless, it is still to this day the world’s largest free-standing masonry building. Because it took 30 years to build, by the time it was completed it was already out of fashion. City government even considered demolishing it in the 1950’s. However, the cost of demolition was equal to the cost of construction, nearly $25 million, and would have bankrupted the city, so fortunately the city decided to suspend any plans for demolition. Today, this building is included among the 150 most important buildings in the United States. This legend is not going anywhere anytime soon. https://billypenn.com/2021/06/14/philadelphia-city-hall-sculptures-calder-macarthur-building-history-masonry-carving/',

The five-story parking garage was quite an advanced feature at the time. 1616 Walnut was built by the Pew Family, owners of the Sun Oil company who had their headquarters next door. The building was mostly office spaces, with the exception of the Pew family apartment on the 25th floor. Like many Art Deco Buildings, a lot of attention to detail was brought to the interior while having a rather subdued exterior cladding. The bronze screen entrance is detailed in zig-zag motifs, the main lobby features rare aluminum trims, and the Pew apartment is ornamented with whimsical decorative woodwork.

            'The Architect’s Building was designed by a group of architectural firms in 1929. It was intended to be “a center for the architectural profession and the building industry of Philadelphia”, with a plan to house architecture firms, engineering firms, and construction companies. Even though it was designed by 20 something architecture firms, it was ironically quickly outdated for its small floor plates and antiquated building systems, like many 20th century towers. It was vacant and in disrepair for several years before the Kimpton hotel chain came along in 2009 to renovate it into a new boutique hotel, named Hotel Palomar. The facade had a partial exterior renovation to the detailed masonry, terracotta and bronze storefront, with a complete window replacement. Some interior elements were restored, like the tiled second-floor elevator landing, but the rooms which once served as studio space for architects were gutted and replaced with energy-efficient systems. Hotel Palomar is the first ever hotel in Philadelphia to hold a Silver LEED Certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Personality:Architect nerdEco-conciousBeauty meets energy efficiencyBook Text:It is rare for early 20th century towers to sustain their original use, but what has stayed true with this building is its devotion to the practice of architecture. From Art Deco details of the 20’s to the energy-efficient systems of the 21st century, the Architect’s Building has always prioritized the most current topics in Architecture.The Architect’s Building was designed by a group of architectural firms in 1929. The team of 20 some firms was primarily led by Paul Cret, and his hand is evident in details like the brass-trimmed French doors, Beaux-Arts pilasters, and Parisian inspired drawing rooms on the top floor. It was intended to be “a center for the architectural profession and the building industry of Philadelphia”, with a plan to house architecture firms, engineering firms, and construction companies. The Philadelphia chapter of the AIA (American Institute of Architects) lived on the 24th floor, and the AIA bookstore was on the ground floor. Even though it was designed by 20 something architecture firms, it was ironically quickly outdated for its small floor plates and antiquated building systems, like many 20th century towers. It was vacant and in disrepair for several years before the Kimpton hotel chain came along to renovate it into a new boutique hotel, named Hotel Palomar. The $51 million remodeling project was led by Gensler Architects in 2009. The facade had a partial exterior renovation to the detailed masonry, terracotta and bronze storefront, with a complete window replacement. Some interior elements were restored, like the tiled second-floor elevator landing, but the rooms which once served as studio space for architects were gutted and replaced with energy-efficient systems. Hotel Palomar is the first ever hotel in Philadelphia to hold a Silver LEED Certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. As green sustainable design has become the primary and most important agenda for many practicing architects today, it is only appropriate that a highrise once known as the Architect’s Building receives such attention to eco-conscious design, water-use reduction, and conservation of energy, setting a prime example for other adaptive reuse projects.https://www.inquirer.com/philly/home/20091002_Changing_Skyline__Proving_green_can_be_gorgeous.html',

            'The Art Deco tower was commissioned by Rodman Wanamaker in 1932. The first seven floors was the Wanamaker’s Men’s Store, and the 24th and 25th floor was a luxury penthouse for Rodman Wanamaker and his wife. The bell tower housed the 15-ton Founder’s Bell. Opening during the Great Depression, the store unfortunately only lasted 20 years in the building. The Philadelphia National Bank (PNB) bought the building and converted it into banking offices in 1952. In an attempt to modernize the building, renovations removed a lot of the detailing and fluting of the original ornate lower facade, and replaced it with granite black slabs on the street level. After several owner changes, the building had been officially renamed to be One South Broad in 1996, but the famous PNB letters decorating the four sides of the bell tower weren’t removed until 2014. More renovations in 2000 converted the lower floors to retail and restaurant space. The granite black slabs added by PNB were removed and replaced with imported Italian granite to better match the original architecture. Personality:Well dressed gentlemanBankerBusiness guy in a nice suitAlso known as Lincoln-Liberty Building or PNB BuildingBook Text:One South Broad has always been in the business of money. Initially designed as a department store catering to the “Phialdleplhia Gentleman”, this building continues to resemble a well suited city bank owner.Built in 1932, the Art deco tower in Center City was commissioned by Rodman Wanamaker. The first seven floors was the Wanamaker’s Men’s Store, and on the 24th and 25th floor was a luxury penthouse for Rodman Wanamaker and his wife, although they lived there only briefly. The bell tower housed the 15-ton Founder’s Bell. The Bell was originally intended to swing, but the swinging of the bell shook the building. It’s now operated mechanically and rings hourly, except for Sundays. Despite opening during the Great Depression, the company had a lot of faith that the store would do exceptionally well, but unfortunately the store only lasted 20 years before moving to the Wanamaker building a few blocks away. The Philadelphia National Bank (PNB) bought the building for $9 million and converted it into banking offices in 1952. The now PNB building decorated the four sides of the bell tower with 16 feet tall stainless steel letters, which forecasted weather by turning letters red to indicate a warming trend, or green for cooling trend. In an attempt to modernize the building, renovations removed a lot of the detailing and fluting of the original ornate lower facade, and replaced it with granite black slabs on the street level. Over the years PNB became CoreState, First Union Corp, Wachovia and then Wells Fargo, which is now the largest tenant occupying most of the building. The building had been officially renamed to be One South Broad in 1996, but the famous PNB letters weren’t removed until 2014. More renovations in 2000 converted the lower floors to retail and restaurant space. The granite black slabs added by PNB were removed and replaced with imported Italian granite to better match the original architecture. Although no longer a department store, One South Broad in a way continues to keep the Wanamaker legacy alive by striving to portray a financially successful, well dressed, Philadelphia gentleman.',

            'Before the Inquirer Building, it was called the Elverson Building, after James Elverson, who was the publisher of the Inquirer from 1889-1911. James Elverson Jr. funded the construction of this building to dedicate to his father. The Beaux-Arts design tower was colloquially called “Tower of Truth”. Elverson Jr. and his wife lived in a duplex apartment on the 12th and 13th floor. In its early years, this newspaper operation was one of the most modern printing plants in the world. It had the largest composing room and the fastest printing presses. However, since the 1980’s the newspaper has gone through significant downsizing with staff buyouts, newsroom cuts, international bureau closures, and other operational cutbacks caused by declining advertising revenue. The Inquirer stood vacant for six years until 2017 when city officials announced plans to make it into the new headquarters for the Philadelphia Police Department. The city has spent $50.5 million to renovate both the interior and exterior. Personality:People pleaserOverachiever Voted in high school “most likely to succeed”Career didn’t take off as plannedHad to re-invent identity after career didn’t take off as plannedWent through a makeover and ready to start their new lifeBook Text:Born into a legacy and destined to succeed, the Inquirer Building was once the most impressive newspaper operation in business. But what started out as an accomplished career soon turned into a desperate need to change career paths. After an expensive makeover, this building is ready to start a new life. Before the Inquirer Building, it was called the Elverson Building, after James Elverson, who was the publisher of the Inquirer from 1889-1911. James Elverson Jr. funded the construction of this building to dedicate to his father. The $10 million project started in 1923 and the Philadelphia Inquirer officially occupied it in 1925. The Beaux-Arts design was in every detail intended to be for a newspaper operation and was colloquially called “Tower of Truth”. Elverson Jr. and his wife lived in a duplex apartment on the 12th and 13th floor. Though it was the tallest building north of City Hall at the time, it was still in a way operated like a  traditional “mom and pop” company with the owners living above the business. In its early years, this newspaper operation was one of the most modern printing plants in the world. It had the largest composing room and the fastest printing presses. However, since the 1980’s the newspaper has gone through significant downsizing with staff buyouts, newsroom cuts, international bureau closures, and other operational cutbacks caused by declining advertising revenue. The Inquirer went through several owner changes and by 2011 it was owned by Philadelphia Media Network. The newspaper operation had to move to 8th and Market, and the building was sold for around $19 million to developer Bart Blatstein. Blatstein had several ideas for how to occupy the Inquirer Building. First plan was to renovate it into a French-themed casino, and then plans changed to make it into a 125 room boutique hotel. The Inquirer instead just stood vacant for six years until 2017 when city officials announced plans to make it into the new headquarters for the Philadelphia Police Department. The city has spent $50.5 million to renovate both the interior and exterior. Renovations have been completed as of 2020, and with a hopeful future, the Inquirer Building now shines brighter than ever.',

The stepped nature of the upper stories is a result of municipal laws that require access to light and air, but the resulting form is actually quite complementary to the Art Deco manner. Although the tower is considered to be Art Deco, it also has some unmistakable Beaux-Arts influences seen in the volutes, swags and garlands. Some of these details interpret classical forms and others are more geometric, abstract, and modern. The design is a unique moment when classical details are evolving into modern characteristics all in one building. In 2001 it was converted into a Residence Inn by Marriott.

            'The Lewis Tower, now known as the Aria, was built in 1929 and designed by architecture firm Edmund Gilchrist. Located in the vicinity of the Rittenhouse neighborhood, The Lewis Tower was one of Phialdelphia/s tallest office buildings until new construction started in Center City in 1980’s. The Art Deco tower’s bright brick cladding made it stand out in the skyline from similar towers that were built in that same year, like the Drake. In 2005, the office tower was sold to be converted into 114 units of condominiums, penthouses on the top three floors, and commercial space on the street level. In the Fall of 2005, a large section of stone facade fell from the 15th floor onto a neighboring building, and so the city ordained the new owners to facilitate major repairs. Exterior renovation included facade scrubbing and treatment, and additionally there were extensive interior renovations. The building was renamed to Aria because of its location just off the Avenue of the Arts.

            'The Equitable Trust Building was designed by Horace Trumbauer in 1922, and commissioned by Louis Cahan, the leader of the Equitable Trust Company. The design is an inspiring Gothic office-castle with fortress towers on the roof. Cahan also requested that the letter “E” was to be placed on every window to mark the company’s name. The ground floor had a large Gothic theater, which was first occupied by The Fox-Locust Theatre in 1927. In 1930, Equitable Trust became part of Chase National Bank, and part of the company moved into the now Wells Fargo Building.

The east wall was left without details with the expectation that this face would be obscured by a neighboring building. Over the next few decades Liberty Title and Trust Building housed various owners. The last owner to vacate the building in 1990’s was the Philadelphia Water Department. In 2008, plans to convert the Liberty Title Building into a hotel were stalled for a couple of years due to the recession. When the Pennsylvania Convention Center started construction in 2011, The Liberty Title and Trust Building was the only existing building on the block to survive the expansion. Renovations were finally completed in 2016 and today it is an Aloft Hotel that is highly praised for its seamless blend between modern life and historic details.',

            'Built in 1926, Beury is a unique blend of Late Gothic Revival and Art Deco. The National Bank of North Philadelphia was the original owner of the building. As World War II swept through the 1940’s, Beury provided rooms to serve as a rationing board office for Philadelphia. It was the largest designated air raid shelter. In 1995, the new owner, Mohammed Mizani, attempted to remove asbestos from the building by using unskilled labor of homeless people. Mizani was found guilty and the building was left abandoned. In 2017, Shift Capital announced plans to renovate. In the most recent development, the plan is to convert it into a Marriott hotel. Today, the most famous feature of The Buery is the signature graffiti, “Forever Boner”. Urban legend says the graffiti was made by two rivaling artists, one named Boner and the other Forever. When plans of development reached the news, there was so much public opposition to the removal of the graffiti that the developers promised to pay homage to the tag and keep it. Personality:Old military veteranTattooedCouple of war injuriesUnder-appreciated for military serviceMisfortune post military serviceBook Text:Battered and bruised, The Bruery building is an old military vet who has been left abandoned for nearly two decades. It is a tale about war, neglect, crime, and hope for redemption. This highrise is a tattooed, infamous badass in Philly who still has much to offer.Built in 1926, architect William H. Lee, a well known theater architect, designed this 14-story apartment building with a unique blend of Late Gothic Revival and Art Deco. A few years after completion, the National Bank of North Philadelphia moved in, and the building was named “The Beury” after Charles Beury, the president of the bank. As World War II swept through the 1940’s, Beury provided rooms to serve as a rationing board office for Philadelphia. It was one of twenty-eight facilities designated as an air raid shelter, and out of the twenty-eight, Beury was the largest holding up to 2,600 people. By 1985 it was abandoned, despite earning its place in the National Register of Historic Places, a medal of honor that did it little to no good. In 1995, then owner, Mohammed Mizani, attempted to remove asbestos from the building by using unskilled labor of homeless people from the city’s center city homeless shelter. After Mizani was found guilty, the building was once again left abandoned. In 2008, there was hope for Buery to become a new home for several displaced city offices that would have housed 900 state employees, but with the hefty price of $30 million, the plans never came to pass. For a decade Buery struggled to find investors that would take a chance on it. Finally in 2017, Shift Capital announced plans to renovate. The initial plan was for 80 apartment units, but in the most recent development the plans have changed to be a 160 room Marriott hotel with a ground floor restaurant. Today, the most famous feature of The Buery is the signature graffiti, “Forever Boner”. Urban legend says the graffiti was made by two rivaling artists, one named Boner and the other Forever. When plans of development reached the news, there was so much public opposition to the removal of the graffiti that the developers promised to pay homage to the tag and keep it. And so The Beury Building lives on, with a hopeful future, still standing strong and proud as “Forever Boner.”Notes:Built in 1926Architect William H.

It was designed by John Torrey Windrim, son of a Beaux-Arts legend John Hamilton Windrim. The 23 story Art Deco tower was far taller than any building in its near vicinity. Illuminated Architecture was becoming a popular trend, and PECO being an electric company, wanted to set the record for best lit building in the world. Arthur A. Brainerd, a technological wizard of the time, designed lighting schemes with multi-colored lights moving across the building, each individually dimming and fading at regular intervals. The cherry on top was a small tower with a rotating spotlight. The building was named the Edison Building in honor of Thomas Edison, who was 80 at the time and was invited to activate the lighting scheme via telegraph on opening night. At its best, the building shined bright at nine watts per square foot and was visible 10 miles away. By the mid 1930’s, Illuminated Architecture was old news so the lighting scheme was changed to be more conventional and taller buildings started to surround the Edison Building. In the mid-1940s, a power plant moved in right next door and attached a massive smokestack to the side of the Edison Building. PECO started to outgrow the Edison Building and moved out in the 1960’s. Jefferson university bought it in 1973 to expand their campus in the city, and installed massive lit-up signs on the north and south sides of the building, an homage to the building's history of impressive lighting.https://hiddencityphila.org/2012/01/electric/#:~:text=Construction%20began%20in%201926%20and,year%2Dold%20Thomas%20Alva%20Edison.",
